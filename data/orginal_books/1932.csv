November 1880 in Klagenfurt geboren. Sein Vater sah für ihn die Militärlaufbahn vor und schickte ihn auf verschiedene Militärakademien. Er brach jedoch die Offizierslaufbahn ab und studierte – nach einem Intermezzo im Maschinenbaustudium – ab 1903 in Berlin Philosophie und Psychologie, und bekam dort ersten Zugang zu Künstlerkreisen. 1910 geht Musil zurück nach Wien. Nach dem Ersten Weltkrieg, an dem er teilnahm, festigt er seinen Ruf als Schriftsteller, und wird mit diversen Preisen ausgezeichnet, u.a. dem Kleist-Preis für das Schauspiel »Die Schwärmer«. 1920 lernt er in Berlin seinen künftigen Verleger, Ernst Rowohlt kennen, der ihn in den nächsten 20 Jahren, während Musil am »Mann ohne Eigenschaften« arbeitet, mit Vorschüssen finanziell unterstützen wird. Musil publiziert nun fast nichts anderes mehr, setzt all seine Kraft in sein Monumentalwerk.<br /><br />Mit dem »Anschluss« Österreichs an den Nationalsozialismus im Jahr 1938 werden Musils Bücher nach Deutschland nun auch in Österreich verboten. Er emigriert mit seiner Frau in die Schweiz, zunächst wohnen sie in Zürich, später bei Genf. – Am 15. April 1942 stirbt Robert Musil an einem Gehirnschlag. Seine Asche wurde in einem Wald bei Genf verstreut.<br />Redaktion eClassica<br /><br />----<br />eClassica – Die Buchreihe, die Klassiker neu belebt."

Galsworthy's masterly narrative examines not only their fortunes but also the wider developments within society, particularly the changing position of women. The author has drawn a fascinating and accurately detailed picture of the British propertied class Often incorrectly called The Forsyte Saga - the nine novel sequence properly known as The Forstye Chronicles contains three trilogies- of which the first trilogy is The Forsyte Saga (The Man of Property - In Chancery- To Let). The second trilogy- A Modern Comedy (The White Monkey- The Silver Spoon- Swan Song) is followed by the third and concluding trilogy- End of the Chapter (Maid in Waiting- Flowering Wilderness- One More River). John Galsworthy (1867-1933) devoted virtually his entire professional career to creating a fictional but entirely representative family of propertied Victorians- the Forsytes. He made their lives and times- loves and losses- fortunes and deaths so real that readers accused him of including as characters in his drama real individuals whom they knew. He was the winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1932."

Galsworthy spares none of his characters, revealing their weaknesses and shortcomings as clearly as he does the tenacity and perseverance that define the strongest members of the Forsyte family.<br />This edition contains the three original novels -- The Man of Property, In Chancery, and To Let -- and their connecting interludes, Indian Summer of a Forsyte and Awakening."

He won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1932. Notable works include The Forsyte Saga (1906-1921) and its sequels, A Modern Comedy and End of the Chapter. From the Four Winds was Galsworthy's first published work in 1897, a collection of short stories. These, and several subsequent works, were published under the pen name John Sinjohn and it would not be until The Island Pharisees (1904) that he would begin publishing under his own name. His first play, The Silver Box (1906) became a success, and he followed it up with The Man of Property (1906), the first in the Forsyte trilogy. Along with other writers of the time such as Shaw his plays addressed the class system and social issues, two of the best known being Strife (1909) and The Skin Game (1920)."

Cuenta las vicisitudes de los principales miembros de una familia britanica de clase media-alta. A solo unas pocas generaciones de sus antepasados granjeros, los miembros de la familia son conscientes de su estatus de nuevos ricos. El personaje principal, Soames Forsyte, se ve a si mismo como un ""propietario,"" en virtud de su capacidad de acumular posesiones materiales, aunque no le aporten placer. Algunos fragmentos de la saga, asi como la historia completa, han sido adaptados a la pantalla. El primer libro, El propietario (The man of property), fue adaptado en 1949 por Hollywood bajo el titulo That Forsyte Woman, protagonizada por Greer Garson, Errol Flynn, Walter Pidgeon y Robert Young. La BBC produjo tambien en 1967 una serie de 26 capitulos sobre la trilogia de los Forsyte, asi como la segunda parte de la trilogia, Una comedia moderna. En el ano 2002 Granada Television produjo dos series para la cadena ITV llamadas La saga de los Forsyte y La sala de los Forsyte: Se alquila. La version de 1967 inspiro al popular programa de television Masterpiece Theatre. En la etapa del cine mudo, la novela tambien fue adaptada en un par de ocasiones."

This anthology of six of the most commonly studied and revived Naturalist plays from the European repertoire offers a unique compendium that will serve as required reading for drama courses and is ideal for theatre practitioners and fans.<br /><br />The selected plays perfectly reflect the formal and geographical diversity of Naturalist theatre as well as its major philosophical, political, and theatrical preoccupations. The volume includes Henrik Ibsen's <i>A Doll's House</i> (1879), August Strindberg's <i>Miss Julie</i> (1888), Gerhart Hauptmann's <i>The Weavers</i> (1892), Bernard Shaw's <i>Mrs Warren's Profession</i> (1893), Anton Chekhov's <i>Three Sisters</i> (1901), and John Galsworthy's <i>Strife </i>(1909). A critical introduction by Dr. Chris Megson contextualizes the emergence of Naturalist theatre in the late nineteenth century, identifying its principal aims and methods; provides an analysis of the selected plays, mapping their key preoccupations; and ends by considering Naturalism's enduring legacy and resonance today."

This type of literary composition has developed remarkably since its rise in the 'Nineties, in England, France, Germany and more especially in America. It is noteworthy that American writers who have done so much with and for the short story should also have been attracted by and have shown proficiency in the composition of the one-act play. The two media, obviously, have many characteristics in common. The swiftness of movement and pitiless pruning away of non-essentials that are indispensable to both have evidently attracted a people that have the reputations of being always in a hurry.<br /><br />There have of course been one-act plays of some sort, time out of mind. They were represented in the religious folk-drama of earlier centuries; in the form of farces they have long been in common use as curtain-raisers or after-pieces; and as ""playlets"" they have been familiar to the vaudeville audiences of the past fifty years. But the one-act plays in this volume, while differing wildly from each other, have little in common with any of the types just mentioned. The modern one-act play at its best is indubitably a work of art, and we have no hesitation in claiming consideration on this ground for the ten plays that are presented here.""<br /><br />Contents:<br /><i>A Night at an Inn</i> Lord Dunsany<br /><i>Beauty and the Jacobin</i> Booth Tarkington<br /><i>Fortune and Men's Eyes</i> Josephine Preston Peabody<br /><i>Overtones</i> Alice Gerstenberg<br /><i>Sham</i>Frank G.

These, and several subsequent works, were published under the pen name John Sinjohn and it would not be until The Island Pharisees (1904) that he would begin publishing under his own name. His first play, The Silver Box (1906) became a success, and he followed it up with The Man of Property (1906), the first in the Forsyte trilogy. Along with other writers of the time such as Shaw his plays addressed the class system and social issues, two of the best known being Strife (1909) and The Skin Game (1920)."

His iron-grey eyes had lost none of their colour, they were set-in deep, so that their upper lids were invisible, and had a peculiar questioning directness, apt to change suddenly into twinkles. His head was of fine shape - one did not suspect that it required a specially made hat, being a size larger than almost any other head; it was framed in very silky silvery hair, brushed in an arch across his forehead, and falling in becoming curves over the tips of his ears; and he wore always a full white beard and moustaches, which concealed a jaw and chin of great determination cleft by a dimple. <br />About the Publisher <br />Forgotten Books publishes hundreds of thousands of rare and classic books.

Wintona, koja se zaljubljuje u svjetski poznatoga guslača Gustava Fiorsena. Nakon vjenčanja, Fiorsen nastavlja s boemskim stilom života, čak i nakon rođenja njihove kćerke. Galsworthy je i u ovome romanu usredotočen na ženu u nesretnom braku, kao i njenu ponovnu priliku da nakon takvoga braka pronađe sreću u ljubavi.<br /><br />""Sišavši u vrt, Gyp se žurno udalji. Nije prešla preko polja, već ispred kućice i zakrenula u malu šumicu iza nje. Tamo sjedne na jedan panj, dlanove pritisne na obraze, a laktove o grudi, i stane zuriti u suncem obasjanu paprat i u muhe, koje su se ondje naganjale. Ljubav! Zar je ljubav uvijek mrska i tužna? Strelovito pogađajući, uzimajući, pa onda strelovito nestajući! Ili navalivši na oboje, prebrzo se gubeći! Zar se nikada nije desilo, da se dvoje zbližilo, sljubilo i zauvijek ostalo jedno? Ljubav! ... Ljubav je dolazila, kad je čovjek nije tražio, a nikada, kad ju je želio. Zloban putnik, koji je umarao duh prije tijela ili opet tijelo prije duha. Bolje, mnogo bolje, da čovjek s njome nema posla. Koji bi slobodan čovjek želio postati robom ... I gledajući sunce na paprati, Gyp pomisli: »Ljubavi! Daleko ti kuća od mene!«"""

The Forsytes believe they will live forever, but the unrelenting, imperturbable fa?ade slowly begins to crumble as Aunt Ann, the oldest Forsyte ever, is interred in the family tomb at the end of this first volume. The author makes his presence and opinion felt with beautifully subtle pinpricks of wit which leave one in no doubt what he thought of the accumulation of wealth and property, which typified the materialistic Victorian psyche, at the expense of sensitivity and freedom. As in 'The Dark Flower' [also published by Assembled Stories], Galsworthy demonstrates a fundamental understanding of hidden sexual currents and their ability to change our destinies.If you have enjoyed 'The Forsyte Saga' on television in the past you will be familiar with this engrossing story; if not, prepare to be completely captivated and engaged by one of the best tales ever told."

Vyše tridsať rokov zaujímal tento ""viktoriánsky"" spisovateľ popredné miesto v anglickej literatúre. V celej svojej tvorbe sa nám javí ako romantický ctiteľ krásy, od svojej prvej zbierky poviedok až po záverečnú časť Konca kapitoly z roku 1933, ktorej vydania sa už nedožil.<br />Jeho dielo, ktoré mu prinieslo úspech doma i vo svete a verejné pocty (ich vyvrcholením bolo udelenie Nobelovej ceny), odzrkadľuje obrovské zmeny, ktorými prechádza Anglicko od konca minulého storočia až po krízové tridsiate roky. Najmä prvý román Ságy - Boháč - jeho najpriebojnejšie dielo, podáva všestranný obraz zámožných Angličanov, opanovaných túžbou po majetku. Máloktorému spisovateľovi sa tak podarilo zachytiť psychózu všadeprítomného vlastníctva, ktorá formuje celý život meštiaka, doslovne od kolísky až po hrob, ako Galsworthymu. Sám vyšiel z týchto ""vlastníckych kruhov"", a preto ich dokonale poznal a vedel tento typ s potrebným odstupom, triezvo a chladne, ale vynikajúco analyzovať. <br />V Konci kapitoly, ktorá iba voľne, niektorými spoločnými postavami, nadväzuje na Modernú komédiu, nepokúša sa už starnúci autor o také nemilosrdné odkrytie typu úspešného meštiaka, ale zväčša naopak - lúči sa, miestami až clivo, so spoločenskou kastou, ktorá nenávratne odumiera - so šľachtou, čo po stáročia oddane slúžila a je na túto službu hrdá, i s chátrajúcimi rodinnými sídlami, podľa Galsworthyho ""dušou anglického vidieka"".<br />Aj v tejto tirlógii, hoci v nej autor neraz upadá do akéhosi hmlistého reforizmu, vytvoril ľudsky zaujímavé postavy. Utiahnutá a obetavá Dinny prežíva svoju mladosť po prvej svetovej vojne, no patrí skôr do minulého storočia a do istej miery je po duševnej a citovej stránke mladšou sestrou Ireny Forsytovej. Jej prudká láska k Wilfridovi Desertovi (ktorého náš čitateľ pozná z Modernej komédie) je márnou vzburou proti spoločenským a náboženským predsudkom kasty, ku ktorej Dinny patrí. Rozpor medzi citom a spoločnosťou, ktorý autor sám za mladi prekonal, podáva na príbehu tejto dvojice s tragickým vypätím, no v závere dielo ho nevyhrocuje, skôr zmierňuje - akoby pod vplyvom svojho presvedčenia, že spoločenské rozpory možno riešiť iba zmierlivo a so vzájomným pochopením.<br />A táto potreba ľudského porozumenia, zdôrazňovaná v celom Galsworthyho diele, patrí k najkrajším a najvýraznejším črtám Konca kapitoly."

Then his cousin Jolyon Forsyte moves in to protect and champion Irene and the old rift in the family splinters into new jealousy, hatred, and fear. But this time it runs too deeply for forgiveness."

At the same time, the content and language of the Readers at Upper Level are carefully controlled with the following main features:<br /><br /><i>Information Control</i> As at other levels in the series, information that is vital for the development of a story is carefully presented in the text and then reinforced through the <i>Points for Understanding</i> section. Some background refeences may be unfamiliar to students, but these are explained in the text and in the <i>Glossary</i>. Care is taken with pronoun reference.<br /><br /><i>Structure Control</i> Students can expect to meet those structures covered in any basic English Course. Particularly difficult structures, such as complex nominal groups and embedded clauses, are used sparingly. Clauses and phrases within sentences are carefully balanced and sentence lenght is limited to a maximum of four clausesin nearly all cases.<br /><br /><i>Vocabulary Control</i> At Upper Leve,l there is a basic vocabulary of approximately 2,200 words. At the same time, students are given the opportunity to meet new words, including simple idiomatic and figurative English usages that are clearly expained in the <i>Glossary</i>."

For the next 7 years he published these and all works under his pen name John Sinjohn. It was only upon the death of his father and the publication of ""The Island Pharisees"" in 1904 that he published as John Galsworthy. Each story in this collection is dedicated to one particular family member so his choices for them are fascinating and the stories are of course excellent. Whilst today he is far more well know as a Nobel Prize winning novelist then he was considered a playwright dealing with social issues and the class system. He was appointed to the Order of Merit in 1929, after earlier turning down a knighthood, and awarded the Nobel Prize in 1932 though he was too ill to attend. John Galsworthy died from a brain tumour at his London home, Grove Lodge, Hampstead on January 31st 1933. In accordance with his will he was cremated at Woking with his ashes then being scattered over the South Downs from an aeroplane."

There is also Jon, the offspring of Jolyon and Irene, a sensitive and intelligent, though slightly naïve, young man of the same age. When these two happen to meet, at an art gallery owned by Jolyon's daughter June, it is love at first sight despite the fulsome objections of both sets of parents.<br /><br />This chance encounter is the first time that Soames has seen Irene since the Queens' funeral 19 years before and the old fever still consumes him. His second marriage has been a disappointment and again he may be a cuckold, deceived by the louche Belgian, Prosper Profond.<br /><br />Jon and his mother leave for Spain where Jolyon hopes the trip will end the young man's passionate feelings, while Fleur waits at home and begins to manipulate the adults to get what she wants. Soames, an anguished man, is once more tormented and perplexed by the women in his life."

Mrs. George-the-Gaul is standing with a jug to give drink to the tired ones. Some stars are already netted in the branches of the pines; the Guinea-fowl are silent. But still the harmonious thresher hums and showers from three sides the straw, the chaff, the corn; and the men fork, and rake, and cart, and carry, sleep growing in their muscles, silence on their tongues, and the tranquillity of the long day nearly ended in their souls.

Through the open doorway, into a dim, cavernous, ruined house of New Orleans we passed. The mildew and dirt, the dark denuded dankness of that old hostel, rotting down with damp and time! And our guide, the tall, thin, grey-haired dame, who came forward with such native ease and moved before us, touching this fungused wall, that rusting stairway, and telling, as it were, no one in her soft, slow speech, things that any one could see-what a strange and fitting figure! Before the smell of the deserted, oozing rooms, before that old creature leading us on and on, negligent of all our questions, and talking to the air, as though we were not, we felt such discomfort that we soon made to go out again into such freshness as there was on that day of dismal heat. Then realising, it seemed, that she was losing us, our old guide turned; for the first time looking in our faces, she smiled, and said in her sweet, weak voice, like the sound from the strings of a spinet long unplayed on: ""Don' you wahnd to see the dome-room: an' all the other rooms right here, of this old-time place?""

Quaint windmo seat deep sunk in the thick wall. Door back leads to dining room. Door right leads to wide hall. At long intervals, people with fire arms pass down this hall; those who carry revolvers lay them on a stout table, those with riﬂes hand them to the man behind the table, who stacks them in the corner of the hall. In this living room are a handsome cabinet, a long Flemish stove, a carved chest, curious brass and pewter dishes, and bits of valuable tapestry."

These three writers do not try to give chunks of life in the rough, life just as it is, full of irrelevancies, crowded with distracting details and broken threads. Many modern writers have tried to reproduce this chaos, but the art I am speaking of is more exacting, it seeks to penetrate to the essentials so that it may interpret life, and to do this it must focus, eliminating what is not essential from what is. Self-restraint, delicacy, a fine sense of form, all are necessary to this type of art; no gush and no blood - and-thunder, and no intrusion of author standing between what he writes and his reader. That does not rule out personality; personality is like the scent of a ﬂower - unseen but known, one of the most precious gifts of authorship.<br /><br />As an artist Galsworthy has made an extraordinary advance. Some writers produce a vivid personal work, a masterpiece perhaps quite early, and never reach that level of expression again. Galsworthy is not among these, he found himself gradually.<br /><br />About the Publisher<br /><br />Forgotten Books publishes hundreds of thousands of rare and classic books.

Along the way she met the charming Tony Croom, but when she refuses to return to her husband he falsely accuses her of adultery in a highly public court trial, and still the woman has no other choice but to plead guilty in conjugal infidelity.

Notable works include The Forsyte Saga (1906-1921) and its sequels, A Modern Comedy and End of the Chapter. He won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1932. John Galsworthy was born at Kingston Hill in Surrey, England, the son of John and Blanche Bailey (nee Bartleet) Galsworthy. His family was wealthy and well established, with a large estate in Kingston upon Thames that is now the site of three schools: Marymount International School, Rokeby Preparatory School, and Holy Cross. He attended Harrow and New College, Oxford, training as a barrister, and was called to the bar in 1890. However, he was not keen to begin practising law and instead travelled abroad to look after the family's shipping business. During these travels he met Joseph Conrad, then the first mate of a sailing-ship moored in the harbour of Adelaide, Australia, and the two future novelists became close friends. In 1895 Galsworthy began an affair with Ada Nemesis Pearson Cooper (1864-1956), the wife of his cousin Major Arthur Galsworthy. After her divorce ten years later, they married 23 September 1905 and stayed together until his death in 1933. Before their marriage, they often stayed clandestinely in a farmhouse called Wingstone in the village of Manaton on Dartmoor, Devon. From 1908 he took out a long lease on part of the building and made it their regular second home until 1923."

Clare Charwell has just fled her sadistic husband to England. Along the way she met the charming Tony Croom, but when she refuses to return to her husband he falsely accuses her of adultery in a highly public court trial, and still the woman has no other choice but to plead guilty in conjugal infidelity. The dirt of divorce, to which any self-respecting woman must hide, yet Clare prefers to rebel openly against her husband, find a job and settle herself in life.

Is Irene having an affair? Certainly her relationship with the architect Bosinney is causing ructions in the family. While attempting reconciliation with his son, Old Jolyon, spurred by June's suffering as she feels herself losing her lover, sends Young Jolyon to sound the mans intentions. In this meeting Young Jolyon reveals the essence of the Forsytes and warns Bosinney about the nature of the class he is defying. 'A Forsyte is a man who is decidedly more than less a slave of property. He knows a good thing, he knows a safe thing, and his grip on property - it doesn't matter whether it be wives, houses, money, or reputation - is his hallmark... they are the middle men, the commercials, the pillars of society, the cornerstones of convention; everything that is admirable'.Will the young man heed the warning or continue to cause more anguish within the family - and, much worse, scandal amongst its peers?"

There is also Jon, the offspring of Jolyon and Irene, a sensitive and intelligent, though slightly na?ve, young man of the same age. When these two happen to meet, at an art gallery owned by Jolyon's daughter June, it is love at first sight despite the fulsome objections of both sets of parents.This chance encounter is the first time that Soames has seen Irene since the Queens' funeral 19 years before and the old fever still consumes him. His second marriage has been a disappointment and again he may be a cuckold, deceived by the louche Belgian, Prosper Profond. Jon and his mother leave for Spain where Jolyon hopes the trip will end the young man's passionate feelings, while Fleur waits at home and begins to manipulate the adults to get what she wants. Soames, an anguished man, is once more tormented and perplexed by the women in his life."

Irene absolves her son and tells him to do what he must for his happiness.Under Fleurs influence Soames visits Robin Hill for the last time to resolve the emotional checkmate and meets a stubborn Jon who feels he must remain true to his fathers wishes.Fleur is devastated when she receives this news and in a wounded, unstable frame of mind agrees to marry Mont.Timothy, the last remaining Forsyte of the older generation dies and the funeral is attended only by Soames, his clerk and two servants. The furniture and effects of 'Forsyte Change' are sold at auction and three days later Soames visits the Forsyte vault at Highgate cemetery. An airplane 'booms overhead' and the new century envelops him. The sun is on his face and there is nature all around but there is a craving in his heart.

He is viewed as one of the first writers of the Edwardian era; challenging in his works some of the ideals of society depicted in the preceeding literature of Victorian England. He won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1932. Notable works include The Forsyte Saga (1906-1921) and its sequels, A Modern Comedy and End of the Chapter. From the Four Winds was Galsworthy's first published work in 1897, a collection of short stories. These, and several subsequent works, were published under the pen name John Sinjohn and it would not be until The Island Pharisees (1904) that he would begin publishing under his own name. His first play, The Silver Box (1906) became a success, and he followed it up with The Man of Property (1906), the first in the Forsyte trilogy. Along with other writers of the time such as Shaw his plays addressed the class system and social issues, two of the best known being Strife (1909) and The Skin Game (1920)."

The many thousands of books in our collection have been sourced from libraries and private collections around the world.The titles that Trieste Publishing has chosen to be part of the collection have been scanned to simulate the original. Our readers see the books the same way that their first readers did decades or a hundred or more years ago. Books from that period are often spoiled by imperfections that did not exist in the original. Imperfections could be in the form of blurred text, photographs, or missing pages. It is highly unlikely that this would occur with one of our books. Our extensive quality control ensures that the readers of Trieste Publishing's books will be delighted with their purchase. Our staff has thoroughly reviewed every page of all the books in the collection, repairing, or if necessary, rejecting titles that are not of the highest quality. This process ensures that the reader of one of Trieste Publishing's titles receives a volume that faithfully reproduces the original, and to the maximum degree possible, gives them the experience of owning the original work.We pride ourselves on not only creating a pathway to an extensive reservoir of books of the finest quality, but also providing value to every one of our readers. Generally, Trieste books are purchased singly - on demand, however they may also be purchased in bulk. Readers interested in bulk purchases are invited to contact us directly to enquire about our tailored bulk rates."

We have met some of the Monts before but I found it confusing to sort out relationships with no visual family tree. In the end I decided to plough on and let them sort themselves out.The narrative hangs on the problems of Hubert Cherrell who is in trouble for shooting, in cold blood, a Bolivian muleteer who had been mistreating the mules and who Hubert claims attacked him with a knife. Hubert has been attached to an expedition officially run by an American Professor of archaeology who has, in fact left all the day to day management to Hubert. The Professor has written an account of the expedition in which he criticised Hubert for his behaviour. However, back in England Hubert is the focus of a scandal and the Mont family gather round to protect him from extradition to Bolivia on a murder charge.Hubert's sister Dinny uses her charms on the American Professor who has fallen in love with her and does all in his power to have Hubert exonerated, including editing any criticism of Hubert's actions out of his published account of the Bolivian expedition. At the same time the Mont family call upon all their influential connections within the establishment. Hubert is a weak character with a strong wife and sisters and interesting uncles, Adrian and Hilary."

Old Jolyon effects a complete reconciliation with his son and changes his will as a result, further distancing himself from his brother James in the process.

Is Irene having an affair? Certainly her relationship with the architect Bosinney is causing ructions in the family. While attempting reconciliation with his son, Old Jolyon, spurred by June's suffering as she feels herself losing her lover, sends Young Jolyon to sound the mans intentions. In this meeting Young Jolyon reveals the essence of the Forsytes and warns Bosinney about the nature of the class he is defying. 'A Forsyte is a man who is decidedly more than less a slave of property. He knows a good thing, he knows a safe thing, and his grip on property - it doesn't matter whether it be wives, houses, money, or reputation - is his hallmark ... they are the middle men, the commercials, the pillars of society, the cornerstones of convention; everything that is admirable'. Will the young man heed the warning or continue to cause more anguish within the family - and, much worse, scandal amongst its peers?"

His work was received with widespread acclaim by the scholarly community and the reading public. In 1902 Mommsen was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature and acclaimed as 'the greatest living master of the art of historical writing'. Mommsen rejected traditional Enlightenment accounts, which glorified ancient Rome; instead, guided by a new and rigorous criticism of sources, Mommsen began the demythologisation of Roman history. In a vivacious and engaging style, Mommsen drew bold parallels between the nineteenth century and classical Rome. <br /><br />Information about this Folio Society edition (taken from the Editorial Note):<br /><br />Theodor Mommsen’s <i>Römische Geschichte</i> was first published in three volumes between 1854 and 1856, and was subsequently revised several times. The text of the present volume is derived from William Purdie Dickson’s translation, first published in four volumes by Richard Bentley in London in 1868, of the fourth German edition.<br /><br />The text printed in the ensuing pages preserves slightly less than half of the 1868 edition’s three-quarters of a million words. In abridging a work of such magnitude, strict guiding principles tend to be honoured as much in their breach as in their observance. With that caveat in mind, therefore, the intention in this edition has been to provide, within a single volume, a continuous narrative of the history of Rome, from the origins of the city down to the Civil War that resulted in the sole rule of Julius Caesar (c.753—46BC). At the same time, it is hoped that the selection represents the essential character of Mommsen’s historical vision, and can be read with both pleasure and profit by a non-specialist audience.<br /><br />In pursuit of these goals, the relative amount of space devoted to each of the main periods of Roman history has been preserved, and Mommsen’s own book divisions and titles retained. Similarly, the original chapter titles and breaks—and indeed even the paragraphing—has been followed as closely as possible. Wirth some obvious exceptions, marginal precedence has been given to social and constitutional developments, and to political events and conflicts in Rome and Italy, over foreign policy and the detailed narration of overseas wars. Consequently, the significant amount of background information that Mommsen provided concerning the foreign nations with which Rome came into violent contact—Etruscans, Celts, Carthaginians and the peoples of the Hellenistic eastern Mediterranean among them—has been almost entirely excised. And the summaries on literature and the arts that were tacked on to the end of each book have also had to be omitted. Within these broad parameters, however, every effort has been made to ensure that the full spectrum of Mommsen's themes, methodology, and style is portrayed.<br /><br />So that the text retains its readability, all cuts have been made silently, without the distraction of frequent ellipses. Where it has proved impossible to provide a continuous narrative in Mommsen’s own words, then editorial linking passages, printed in smaller type than the rest of the text, have been supplied. These confine themselves to the bare essentials and take a deliberately conservative line in order to sit more comfortably with the main narrative. the new maps and extensive chronology are also intended to compensate for information otherwise excised. A handful of editorial footnotes and other brief interpolations have been added where essential for sense. All such additions to the original text, as well as any other localised rewordings necessitated by the cuts, are contained within square brackets. Most of Mommsen’s analogies to subsequent historical events, which are one of the many delights of his work, require no explanation for an educated readership.<br /><br />Any attempt to update Mommsen’s scholarship would be presumptuous, if not completely foolhardy, and so all points of fact and interpretation have been allowed to stand without comment. thus, for example, Mommsen’s belief that Caesar was probably born in 102BC—rather than 100 BC, as is now generally accepted—has not been amended. Nor has it been deemed necessary to bring into line with current accepted norms either the spelling of proper nouns or Disckon’s faithful equivalents of Mommsen’s deliberately idiosyncratic and anachronistic rendition of Latin terms. Of these, the most noticeable is undoubtedly the word ‘burgess’ instead of ‘citizen’. While proving that few things date faster than modernity, they also provide an important reminder that Mommsen wrote his history with the pressing political and national issues facing both pre-unification Germany and the rest of the mid-nineteenth0century Europe directly in mind."

His work regarding Roman history is still of fundamental importance for contemporary research. He received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1902, and was also a prominent German politician, as a member of the Prussian and German parliaments. His works on Roman law and on the law of obligations had a significant impact on the German civil code (BGB). Mommsen published over 1,500 works, and effectively established a new framework for the systematic study of Roman history. He pioneered epigraphy, the study of inscriptions in material artifacts. Although the unfinished History of Rome has been widely considered as his main work, the work most relevant today is perhaps the Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum, a collection of Roman inscriptions he contributed to the Berlin Academy. He also published the fundamental collections in Roman law: the Corpus Luris Civilis and the Codex Theodosianus."

Roman ideals of civilization were realized thru conquest &amp; expansion, creating a two-way street in which Roman law &amp; custom were tempered &amp; changed by outside contact. Describing the widening sphere of Roman influence, he 1st examines the acquisiton &amp; control of Gaul, Spain, Britain &amp; the lands along the Danube, as well as Greece &amp; Asia Minor. Then he discusses Rome's more difficult domination of the present-day Middle East, N. Africa &amp; the frontiers along the Euphrates. He reminds us that great poets &amp; philosophers, as well as several emperors, came from the provinces, demonstrating that the imperial glory played itself out well beyond the city's borders."

The work was divided into three parts: the Codex Justinianus contained all of the extant imperial enactments from the time of Hadrian; the Digesta compiled the writings of great Roman jurists; and the Institutiones was intended as a textbook for law schools. However, Justinian later found himself obliged to create more laws, and these were published as the Novellae. This three-volume Latin edition of 1872 95, prepared by the great classical historian Theodor Mommsen (1817 1903) and his colleagues, is the culmination of centuries of palaeographical and legal studies.

Y en su dilatado paisaje histórico destacan irremediablemente algunas figuras singulares. Triunfantes con el favor de los acontecimientos o enfrentados a ellos y aplastados por el fracaso, se le imponen al lector con fuerza irresistible. Por eso era ca si forzoso que alguien extrajera del vasto relato del sabio alemán algunas viñetas biográficas y las publicara por separado formando un pequeño libro de fácil y amena lectura como el que el lector tiene en sus manos [...]. Una galería de retratos como la que aquí se recoge suscita al punto en el lector una meditación sobre el papel del individuo en la historia�. (Del prólogo de Francisco Socas)<br /><br />Theodor Mommsen (Garding, 1817-Charlottenburg, 1903) llevó una intensa vida entregada al estudio del mundo antiguo, aunque no faltaron en su trayectoria experiencias periodísticas, políticas y, de algún modo revolucionarias, que dieron fe de un hombre que participó activamente del tiempo que le tocó vivir: el siglo XIX y en concreto todo el proceso de la reunificación de Alemania. Sus obras, muy numerosas, estudian principalmente todo lo referente a la antigüedad romana: derecho, historia, filología, epigrafía, numismática, etc. Como filólogo cabe señalar su Estudio sobre los dialectos de la baja Italia (1850) y sus ediciones de Plinio el Joven. Como numismático su obra fundamental es el Tratado sobre el sistema monetario de los romanos. Pero el gran legado de Mommsen es y será la Historia de Roma, obra aparecida entonces en tres volúmenes, entre los años 1854 y 1856, y donde confluyen en toda su grandeza, genialidad y esplendor la figura del escritor, historiador, periodista, político y pensador que fue Mommsen. Por este libro le concedieron en 1902 el Premio Nobel de Literatura, y se ha convertido hoy en todo un clásico, un referente y un hito de la historiografía romana.<br /><br />Francisco Socas ha sido profesor de Lenguas Clásicas en la Universidad de Sevilla. Ha publicado numerosos trabajos sobre el mundo antiguo, entre los que destacan su tesis sobre la Fortuna en la novela antigua y versiones de poetas latinos (Lucrecio, Ovidio, Juvenal y Marcial). También ha llevado a cabo ediciones de obras heterodoxas o mal conocidas, como el De pulchro et de amore (1531) de Agostino Nifo, Mi vida (1575) y Mis libros (1562) de Girolamo Cardano, el texto irreligioso clandestino Symbolum sapientiae (1668), las novelescas Memorias (1542) de Francisco de Enzinas, el Sueño (1630) del astrónomo Johannes Kepler o Los remedios de amor del poeta sevillano Pedro Venegas de Saavedra. Se ha ocupado de crónicas y descripciones geográficas como la Europa de mi tiempo y la Descripción de Asia, obras ambas de Enea Silvio Piccolomini (s. XV)."

The renowned German scholar proposed an original and sometimes controversial understanding of Roman institutions, based around the categories of nineteenth-century constitutional law. The Romans themselves never actually codified their complicated body of law, but by applying a historical approach to describe the development of Roman law Mommsen succeeds in making it more accessible to the reader. He systematises the many diverse legal elements upon which the Roman constitution was based and offers a coherent reading of it. Volume 3, Part 2 focuses mainly on the Roman Senate. Mommsen lists the number of senators, the process by which they were elected and their qualifications. He describes the Senate's rights, duties and protocol, and its jurisdiction and influence in various spheres within Rome and across the empire."

Although many historians have either ignored the racial factor in the cause of the fall of the Roman Empire, there have been many who recognized race as the critical element in Rome's history. The essay in this book summarizes all the points made by these authors and provides a critically-needed antidote to modern liberal historical interpretations which pretend that race does not exist-and that racial change was the reason for the fall of the Roman Empire.

His work was received with widespread acclaim by the scholarly community and the reading public. In 1902 Mommsen was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature and acclaimed as 'the greatest living master of the art of historical writing'. Mommsen rejected traditional Enlightenment accounts, which glorified ancient Rome; instead, guided by a new and rigorous criticism of sources, he began the demythologisation of Roman history. In a vivacious and engaging style, Mommsen drew bold parallels between the nineteenth century and classical Rome. Volume 4 covers the establishment of the military monarchy; this English translation, first published in 1866, corresponds to the fourth edition of the German third volume. Part 2 begins with Pompey and Julius Caesar and ends with the battle of Thapsus. In this reissue, the index to the entire work is also included."

The renowned German scholar proposed an original and sometimes controversial understanding of Roman institutions, based around the categories of nineteenth-century constitutional law. The Romans themselves never actually codified their complicated body of law, but by applying a historical approach to describe the development of Roman law Mommsen succeeds in making it more accessible to the reader. He systematises the many diverse legal elements upon which the Roman constitution was based and offers a coherent reading of it. In Volume 1 Mommsen focuses on the system of local government and describes in detail how it functioned. He explains the protection offered by the Pontifex maximus and the authority held by the civil and criminal courts, as well as the civil rights given to each community."

The Romans themselves never actually codified their complicated body of law, but by applying a historical approach to describe the development of Roman law Mommsen succeeds in making it more accessible to the reader. He systematises the many diverse legal elements upon which the Roman constitution was based and offers a coherent reading of it. In Volume 2, Part 2 Mommsen explains the origins and development of the Principate (the office of the Roman emperor), and describes the role of the imperial household. He also covers the tribunal court and the institutions responsible for governing Rome and Italy."

It was intended to be a complete codification of all law, to be used as the only source of law in all the courts of the empire. The work was divided into three parts: the Codex Justinianus contained all of the extant imperial enactments from the time of Hadrian; the Digesta compiled the writings of great Roman jurists; and the Institutiones was intended as a textbook for law schools. However, Justinian later found himself obliged to create more laws, and these were published as the Novellae. This three-volume Latin edition of 1872-95, prepared by the great classical historian Theodor Mommsen (1817-1903) and his colleagues, is the culmination of centuries of palaeographical and legal studies."

Aber uberall ist in Mommsens Forschung die Verbindung juristischer, historischer und philologischer Betrachtung eine so innige, da� es unmoglich ist, die einzelnen Abteilungen dieser Sammlung durch feste Schranken voneinander zu scheiden.

Applying the same historical method, he attributes the evolution of criminal law to the demise of the Roman Republic. The book, here reissued in two volumes, is divided into five main sections. The first discusses the nature of criminal law. Mommsen next looks at the institutions involved in administering criminal law, and the roles of different officials within them. He identifies three types of trial: trial by magistrate alone, trial by magistrate and comitia, and trial by jury, and describes their stages from the courtroom process to the pronouncement of sentence. Sections 4 and 5, in the second volume, consider particular crimes, from treason or murder to heresy, rape and theft, and explain the possibilities for appeal and the different categories of sentences ranging from the death penalty or exile to fines."

One who wants to get joy of book reading especially in very less time can go for it. About The Book Theodor Mommsen was born at Garding in Schleswig on November 30, 1817. He studied at Kiel University for three years, examined Roman inscriptions in France and Italy from 1844 to 1847, and attained his first professorship at Leipzig in 1848, and the Berlin Chair of Ancient History in 1858. His greatest work was the ""History of Rome,"" published in 1854, and its successor, the ""Roman Provinces."" On this work he brought to bear a research and a scholarship of almost unparalleled range and completeness. He was a man capable of vehement and occasionally unreasonable partisanship, and a strict and cold-blooded impartiality would have tempered the enthusiasm of some of his portraits and the severity of others. These defects, however, are less obvious when his history is condensed in small compass. There are cases in which his judgments are open to adverse criticism. But at the present day it may safely be affirmed that there is no extant history of Rome down to the establishment of the empire which can be regarded as rivalling that here presented. Upwards of 900 separate publications remain as a monument of Mommsen's industry. He died on November 1, 1903.

The renowned German scholar proposed an original and sometimes controversial understanding of Roman institutions, based around the categories of nineteenth-century constitutional law. The Romans themselves never actually codified their complicated body of law, but by applying a historical approach to describe the development of Roman law Mommsen succeeds in making it more accessible to the reader. He systematises the many diverse legal elements upon which the Roman constitution was based and offers a coherent reading of it. In Volume 2, Part 1 the author focuses on individual roles and appointments within the legislature, from the pontifex and the consuls to the tribune and the questors, as well as legates and other officials."

His work was received with widespread acclaim by the scholarly community and the reading public. In 1902 Mommsen was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature and acclaimed as 'the greatest living master of the art of historical writing'. Mommsen rejected traditional Enlightenment accounts, which glorified ancient Rome; instead, guided by a new and rigorous criticism of sources, he began the demythologisation of Roman history. In a vivacious and engaging style, Mommsen drew bold parallels between the nineteenth century and classical Rome. Volume 4 covers the establishment of the military monarchy; this English translation, first published in 1866, corresponds to the fourth edition of the German third volume. Part 2 begins with Pompey and Julius Caesar and ends with the battle of Thapsus. In this reissue, the index to the entire work is also included."

The renowned German scholar proposed an original and sometimes controversial understanding of Roman institutions, based around the categories of nineteenth-century constitutional law. The Romans themselves never actually codified their complicated body of law, but by applying a historical approach to describe the development of Roman law Mommsen succeeds in making it more accessible to the reader. He systematises the many diverse legal elements upon which the Roman constitution was based and offers a coherent reading of it. In Volume 2, Part 1 the author focuses on individual roles and appointments within the legislature, from the pontifex and the consuls to the tribune and the questors, as well as legates and other officials."

Applying the same historical method, he attributes the evolution of criminal law to the demise of the Roman Republic. The book, here reissued in two volumes, is divided into five main sections. The first discusses the nature of criminal law. Mommsen next looks at the institutions involved in administering criminal law, and the roles of different officials within them. He identifies three types of trial: trial by magistrate alone, trial by magistrate and comitia, and trial by jury, and describes their stages from the courtroom process to the pronouncement of sentence. Sections 4 and 5 in the second volume consider particular crimes, from murder to theft, and explain the possibilities for appeal and the different categories of sentences, which range from the death penalty to fines."

His work was received with widespread acclaim by the scholarly community and the reading public. In 1902 Mommsen was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature and acclaimed as 'the greatest living master of the art of historical writing'. Mommsen rejected traditional Enlightenment accounts, which glorified ancient Rome; instead, guided by a new and rigorous criticism of sources, Mommsen began the demythologisation of Roman history. In a vivacious and engaging style, Mommsen drew bold parallels between the nineteenth century and classical Rome. Volume 3 covers the turbulent period from the reforms of Tiberius Gracchus to the death of Sulla, with separate chapters on nationality, religion and education, and the Roman economy. This English translation, first published in 1863, is based on the German third edition (1861)."

Applying the same historical method, he attributes the evolution of criminal law to the demise of the Roman Republic. The book, here reissued in two volumes, is divided into five main sections. The first discusses the nature of criminal law. Mommsen next looks at the institutions involved in administering criminal law, and the roles of different officials within them. He identifies three types of trial: trial by magistrate alone, trial by magistrate and comitia, and trial by jury, and describes their stages from the courtroom process to the pronouncement of sentence. Sections 4 and 5, in the second volume, consider particular crimes, from treason or murder to heresy, rape and theft, and explain the possibilities for appeal and the different categories of sentences ranging from the death penalty or exile to fines."

Keil published editions of Propertius and of Pliny's letters before turning to the works of the Latin grammarians, whose attempts to define and describe their own language have influenced the way in which modern researchers in language and linguistics have approached their discipline. Keil's only predecessor in this field was Helias Putsch, who in 1605 published Grammaticae Latinae auctores antiqui; Keil uses the same order in which to present his versions of the texts.

Keil published editions of Propertius and of Pliny's letters before turning to the works of the Latin grammarians, whose attempts to define and describe their own language have influenced the way in which modern researchers in language and linguistics have approached their discipline. Keil's only predecessor in this field was Helias Putsch, who in 1605 published Grammaticae Latinae auctores antiqui; Keil uses the same order in which to present his versions of the texts.

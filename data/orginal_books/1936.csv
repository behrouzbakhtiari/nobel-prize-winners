First published by Yale University Press in 1956, it won the Pulitzer Prize in 1957 and has since sold more than one million copies. This edition includes a new foreword by Harold Bloom.<br /><br />The action covers a fateful, heart-rending day from around 8:30 am to midnight, in August 1912 at the seaside Connecticut home of the Tyrones - the semi-autobiographical representations of O'Neill himself, his older brother, and their parents at their home, Monte Cristo Cottage.<br /><br />One theme of the play is addiction and the resulting dysfunction of the family. All three males are alcoholics and Mary is addicted to morphine. They all constantly conceal, blame, resent, regret, accuse and deny in an escalating cycle of conflict with occasional desperate and half-sincere attempts at affection, encouragement and consolation."

His plays involve characters who inhabit the fringes of society, engaging in depraved behaviour, where they struggle to maintain their hopes and aspirations but ultimately slide into disillusionment and despair. O'Neill wrote only one comedy Ah, Wilderness!, all his other plays involve some degree of tragedy and personal pessimism. O'Neill's first published play, Beyond the Horizon, opened on Broadway in 1920 to great acclaim, and was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. His best-known plays include Anna Christie (Pulitzer Prize 1922), The First Man (1922), and The Hairy Ape (1922). In 1936 he received the Nobel Prize for Literature."

They represent the crowning achievements of his career.<br /><br />O’Neill described <em>Ah, Wilderness!</em> as “the way I would have <em>liked</em> my boyhood to have been.” Set in the summer of 1906, it affectionately depicts the warm, close family of 16-year-old Richard Miller and the innocence with which he faces the trials of first love, strong drink, and sexual temptation.<br /><br />John Loving, hero of <em>Days Without End</em>, is split by his lack of faith into two selves: John and his Mephistophelian double Loving, who wears John’s death mask and plots his destruction. Burdened by guilt but desperately wanting to love, John struggles with Loving’s nihilistic hatred in what O’Neill termed his “modern miracle play.”<br /><br />In <em>A Touch of the Poet</em>, Irish tavern-keeper Con Melody is drawn by his proud past as a Byronic cavalry hero of the Napoleonic Wars toward a fatal confrontation with his wealthy Yankee neighbors, the Harfords.<br /><br />Throughout <em>More Stately Mansions</em>, the idealistic yet cunning Simon Harford, his wife, Sara Melody Harford, and his mother, Deborah, continually shift roles and alliances as they engage in an eerie psychological and sexual battle for possession of each other and their own maddeningly elusive dreams. This volume presents the never-before-published complete text of the revised typescript for this unfinished play.<br /><br />The derelict inhabitants of Harry Hope’s saloon in <em>The Iceman Cometh</em> find solace in their comradeship until their drifting calm is destroyed by the visiting salesman Theodore Hickey, who insists that they abandon all “pipe dreams” and face the truth about their lives. O’Neill carefully orchestrates the voices of over a dozen characters to form a chorus of overwhelming despair and surprising compassion.<br /><br /><em>Hughie</em> is a one-act dialogue between a reminiscing gambler and a weary hotel night clerk about the promise and loneliness of city life.<br /><br /><em>Long Day’s Journey into Night</em> unsparingly dissects the pain, rage, guilt, and love that drive a wounded family apart and bind it together. In their summer home the four Tyrones—James, a proud actor haunted by poverty, his devout, morphine-addicted wife, Mary, and their sons, Jamie, a cynical drunkard, and Edmund, an aspiring poet—slowly unveil the truth about their lives until they can no longer hope either to save or to escape one another. Published and produced posthumously, it won O’Neill his fourth Pulitzer Prize.<br /><br />In its elegiac coda, <em>A Moon for the Misbegotten</em>, Jamie Tyrone seeks the peace that has long eluded him in the arms of sharp-tongued Josie Hogan.<br /><br />The volume concludes with “Tomorrow” (1917), O’Neill’s only published short story."

M. Forster, perhaps the greatest living author of the time. Subsequent issues carried interviews with, among others, François Mauriac, Graham Greene, Irwin Shaw, William Styron, Ralph Ellison, and William Faulkner; in the intervening years, many of the world's most significant writers (Ezra Pound, Robert Frost, Ernest Hemingway, John Updike, and John Dos Passos) sat down with The Paris Review. Many of the interviews have been collected in a series of volumes entitled Writers at Work. From these interviews, The Paris Review's editor, George Plimpton, has selected the best and most illuminating insights that the writers have provided and arranged them by subject rather than by author.<br /><br />The book is divided into four parts: ""The Writer: A Profile"" (including the sections ""On Reading,"" ""On Work Habits,"" On the Audience,"" etc.); Part II is ""Technical Matters"" (""On Style,"" ""On Plot,"" etc.); Part III is ""Different Forms"" (""On Biography,"" ""On Journalism""); and Part IV is ""The Writer's Life,"" covering topics like conferences, courses, and teaching, along with a section in which writers provided portraits of other writers.<br /><br /><i>The Writer's Chapbook</i> is a fund of observations by writers on writing. These range from marvelous one-liners (Eugene O'Neill on critics: ""I love every bone in their heads""; T.S. Eliot on editors: ""I suppose some editors are failed writers—but so are most writers"") to expositions on plot, character, and the technical process of putting pen to paper and doing it for a living. ""I don't even have a plot,"" says Norman Mailer; Paul Bowles describes writing in bed; Toni Morrison talks about inventing characters; and Edward Albee and Tom Wolfe explain where they discovered the titles for Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf and The Bonfire of the Vanities.<br /><br />This book is a treasure.

This volume, the second of three, contains 13 plays written between 1920 and 1931, years in which O’Neill achieved his greatest popularity while experimenting with a wide variety of subjects and styles.<br /><br />In <em>Diff’rent</em>, <em>The First Man</em>, and <em>Welded</em>, egotistical characters have their illusions about love shaken by the force of other people’s desires. <em>All God’s Chillun Got Wings</em> depicts the web of racial hatreds and spiritual longings that surround the marriage of a black man and a white woman.<br /><br /><em>The Fountain</em> tells of Ponce de Leon’s search for the fountain of youth. Marco Millions satirizes American materialism by portraying Marco Polo as a hustling businessman blind to the riches of Eastern culture. <em>Lazarus Laughed</em> shows its Biblical hero preaching love, laughter, and the defeat of death.<br /><br />The stoker Yank in <em>The Hairy Ape</em>, the architect Dion Anthony in <em>The Great God Brown</em>, and the minister’s son Reuben Light in <em>Dynamo</em> all try to find a place for themselves in an increasingly soulless and mechanistic world. Yank believes that he “belongs” in his stokehold until a terrified heiress calls him a “filthy beast.” His rage turns to despair as he encounters a brutally indifferent society onshore. <em>The Great God Brown</em> uses masks to depict the divided souls of its hero, his wife, and his alter ego, the successful businessman William Brown. Betrayed by his mother, Reuben Light forsakes the God of his father for the new electrical god of the dynamo but finds no escape from the sexual conflicts that O’Neill characteristically intertwines with his hero’s religious doubts.<br /><br /><em>Strange Interlude</em> follows its heroine Nina Leeds through nine acts and 25 years of passionate and painful involvement with three men. Inspired by contemporary psychology, the novels of James Joyce, and the soliloquies of the Elizabethan theater, O’Neill uses spoken asides to reveal the shifting flow of his character’s inner thoughts. His most commercially successful play, it won him his third Pulitzer Prize.<br /><br />Ephraim Cabot, the patriarchal farmer in <em>Desire Under the Elms</em>, believes in a God as hard as the stony ground he works. He takes as his third wife sensual Abbie Putnam, who covets both his land and his resentful son Eben, unleashing passions that move with stark inexorability toward their fulfillment. In <em>Mourning Becomes Electra</em>, murderous lusts and hatreds wreak havoc upon the proud Mannon family, leaving the survivors pursued not by the avenging Furies of Greek myth but by their own scourging consciences. Searching desperately for peace, they repeatedly confront the temptation to choose oblivion that will haunt many of O’Neill’s last plays."

This <em>Library of America</em> volume (the first in a three-volume set) contains 29 plays he wrote between 1913, when he began his career, and 1920, the year he first achieved Broadway success.<br /><br />Many of O’Neill’s early plays are one-act melodramas whose characters are caught in extreme situations. <em>Thirst</em> and <em>Fog</em> depict shipwreck survivors, The Web a young mother trapped in the New York underworld, and <em>Abortion</em> the aftermath of a college student’s affair with a stenographer.<br /><br />His first distinctive works are four one-act plays about the crew of the tramp steamer <em>Glencairn</em> that render sailors’ speech with masterful faithfulness. <em>Bound East for Cardiff</em>, <em>In the Zone</em>, <em>The Long Voyage Home</em>, and <em>The Moon of the Caribbees</em> portray these “children of the sea” as they watch over a dying man, sail though submarine-patrolled waters, take their shore leave in a London dive, and drink rum in a moonlit tropical anchorage.<br /><br />In <em>Beyond the Horizon</em> Robert Mayo begins a tragic chain of events by abandoning his dream of a life at sea, choosing instead to marry the woman his brother loves and remain on his family farm. The sea in “Anna Christie” is both “dat ole devil” to coal barge captain Chris Christopherson and a source of spiritual cleansing to his daughter Anna, an embittered prostitute. When a swaggering stoker falls in love with her, Anna becomes the apex of a three-sided struggle full of enraged pride, grim foreboding, and stubborn hope. Both of these plays won the Pulitzer Prize and helped establish O’Neill as a successful Broadway playwright.<br /><br /><em>The Emperor Jones</em> depicts the nightmarish journey through a West Indian forest of Brutus Jones, a former Pullman porter turned island ruler. Fleeing his rebellious subjects, Jones confronts his violent deeds and the tortured history of his race in a series of hallucinatory episodes whose expressionist quality anticipates many of O’Neill’s later plays."

For over ninety years, it was believed that the play was irrevocably lost, until it was recently discovered that O’Neill’s second wife had in fact retained a copy, which she later gave to the prolific screenwriter and producer Philip Yordan. In early 2011, Yordan’s widow discovered the typescript of <i>Exorcism—</i>complete with edits in O’Neill’s own hand—in her late husband’s vast trove of papers. The discovery and publication of <i>Exorcism</i>, a relatively early play in the O’Neill corpus, furthers our knowledge of O’Neill’s dramatic development and reveals a pivotal point in the career of this great American playwright.<br /><br />Revolving around a suicide attempt, <i>Exorcism</i> draws on a dark incident in O’Neill’s own life. This defining event led to his first serious efforts to write. <i>Exorcism</i> displays early examples of O’Neill’s unparalleled skills of capturing deeply personal human drama, and it explores major themes—mourning and melancholia, addiction and sobriety, tensions between fathers and sons—that would permeate his later work. According to Yale University’s Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library curator Louise Bernard, who acquired the play from a New York bookseller, “<i>Exorcism</i> might be read as a preparatory sketch that resonates powerfully with <i>Long Day’s Journey into Night, </i>one that brings the O’Neill family drama full circle in ways at once intimate and grandly conceived.”"

In fact, I deny the ugliness entirely, for its vices are often nobler than its virtues, and nearly always closer to a revelation ....To me, the tragic alone has that significant beauty which is truth. It is the meaning of life -- and the hope. The noblest is eternally the most tragic. The people who succeed and do not push on to a greater failure are the spiritual middle-classers.

Much of his childhood was spent in the comfort of books at boarding schools whilst his actor father was on the road and his Mother contended with her own demons. He spent only a year at University - Princeton - and various reasons have been given for his departure. However whatever his background and education denied or added to his development it is agreed amongst all that he was a playwright of the first rank and possibly America's greatest. His introduction of realism into American drama was instrumental in its development and paved a path for many talents thereafter. Of course his winning of both the Pulitzer Prize (4 times) and the Nobel Prize are indicative of his status. His more famous and later works do side with the disillusionment and personal tragedy of those on the fringes of society but continue to build upon ideas and structures he incorporated in his early one act plays. Eugene O'Neill suffered from various health problems, mainly depression and alcoholism. In the last decade he also faced a Parkinson's like tremor in his hands which made writing increasingly difficult. But out of such difficulties came plays of the calibre of <i>The Iceman Cometh</i>, <i>Long Day's Journey into Night</i>, and <i>A Moon for the Misbegotten</i>. Eugene O'Neill died in Room 401 of the Sheraton Hotel on Bay State Road in Boston, on November 27, 1953, at the age of 65. As he was dying, he whispered his last words: ""I knew it. I knew it. Born in a hotel room and died in a hotel room."""

More than any other dramatist, O'Neill introduced American drama to the dramatic realism pioneered by Russian playwright Anton Chekhov, Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen, and Swedish playwright August Strindberg, and was the first to use true American vernacular in his speeches. His plays involve characters who inhabit the fringes of society, engaging in depraved behaviour, where they struggle to maintain their hopes and aspirations but ultimately slide into disillusionment and despair. O'Neill wrote only one comedy Ah, Wilderness!, all his other plays involve some degree of tragedy and personal pessimism. O'Neill's first published play, Beyond the Horizon, opened on Broadway in 1920 to great acclaim, and was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. His best-known plays include Anna Christie (Pulitzer Prize 1922), The First Man (1922), and The Hairy Ape (1922). In 1936 he received the Nobel Prize for Literature."

Much of his childhood was spent in the comfort of books at boarding schools whilst his actor father was on the road and his Mother contended with her own demons. He spent only a year at University - Princeton - and various reasons have been given for his departure. However whatever his background and education denied or added to his development it is agreed amongst all that he was a playwright of the first rank and possibly America's greatest. His introduction of realism into American drama was instrumental in its development and paved a path for many talents thereafter. Of course his winning of both the Pulitzer Prize (4 times) and the Nobel Prize are indicative of his status. His more famous and later works do side with the disillusionment and personal tragedy of those on the fringes of society but continue to build upon ideas and structures he incorporated in his early one act plays. Eugene O'Neill suffered from various health problems, mainly depression and alcoholism. In the last decade he also faced a Parkinson's like tremor in his hands which made writing increasingly difficult. But out of such difficulties came plays of the calibre of The Iceman Cometh, Long Day's Journey Into Night, and A Moon for the Misbegotten. Eugene O'Neill died in Room 401 of the Sheraton Hotel on Bay State Road in Boston, on November 27, 1953, at the age of 65. As he was dying, he whispered his last words: ""I knew it. I knew it. Born in a hotel room and died in a hotel room.""</p>"

His plays involve characters who inhabit the fringes of society, engaging in depraved behaviour, where they struggle to maintain their hopes and aspirations but ultimately slide into disillusionment and despair. O'Neill wrote only one comedy Ah, Wilderness , all his other plays involve some degree of tragedy and personal pessimism. O'Neill's first published play, Beyond the Horizon, opened on Broadway in 1920 to great acclaim, and was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. His best-known plays include Anna Christie (Pulitzer Prize 1922), The First Man (1922), and The Hairy Ape (1922). In 1936 he received the Nobel Prize for Literature."

Much of his childhood was spent in the comfort of books at boarding schools whilst his actor father was on the road and his Mother contended with her own demons. He spent only a year at University - Princeton - and various reasons have been given for his departure. However whatever his background and education denied or added to his development it is agreed amongst all that he was a playwright of the first rank and possibly America's greatest. His introduction of realism into American drama was instrumental in its development and paved a path for many talents thereafter. Of course his winning of both the Pulitzer Prize (4 times) and the Nobel Prize are indicative of his status. His more famous and later works do side with the disillusionment and personal tragedy of those on the fringes of society but continue to build upon ideas and structures he incorporated in his early one act plays. Eugene O'Neill suffered from various health problems, mainly depression and alcoholism. In the last decade he also faced a Parkinson's like tremor in his hands which made writing increasingly difficult. But out of such difficulties came plays of the calibre of <i>The Iceman Cometh</i>, <i>Long Day's Journey into Night</i>, and <i>A Moon for the Misbegotten</i>. Eugene O'Neill died in Room 401 of the Sheraton Hotel on Bay State Road in Boston, on November 27, 1953, at the age of 65. As he was dying, he whispered his last words: ""I knew it. I knew it. Born in a hotel room and died in a hotel room."""

Violenza e desiderio in continua oscillazione, antagonisti, ma in realtà così simili che raramente si possono addebitare a un personaggio singolo.

O'Neill won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1936 and he also was one of the first American writers of realism. Some of O'Neill's most famous plays include Long Day's Journey into Night, Anna Christie, The Iceman Cometh, and Morning Becomes Electra. This collection includes the following: The Straw: A semi-autobiographical play with themes such as family life, love, and deception. Anna Christie: A play that earned O'Neill the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1922. The action centers around a former prostitute who tries to turn her life around. The First Man: A play that centers around an anthropologist who travels to the Asian Plains to find the ""missing link"" in mankind's evolution. The Hairy Ape: A play that centers around a working-class brute, known as Yank, who struggles to find his place in the world. Tomorrow: A short story centering around a suicide in a saloon where O'Neill lived in 1911."

It remains worth hearing.” <br />“An important work about an unknown O’Neill that will reveal this fascinating personality to the general public.” –Paul Shyre<br />Travis Bogard, emeritus professor of dramatic art at the University of California, Berkeley, has edited many works and papers of O’Neill, including, with Jackson R. Bryer, “<i>The Theatre We Worked For”</i>: <i>The Letters of Eugene O’Neill to Kenneth Macgowan.</i>"

It was O'Neill's first full-length work, and the winner of the 1920 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. <i>Beyond the Horizon</i> premiered on Broadway at the Morosco Theatre in 1920.<br /><br />The play takes place on a farm in the Spring, and then moves forward three years later, in the Summer, and finally 5 years later, in late Fall. The play focuses on the portrait of a family, and particularly two brothers Andrew and Robert. In the first act of the play, Robert is about to go off to sea with their uncle Dick, a sea captain while Andrew looks forward to marrying his sweetheart Ruth and working on the family farm as he starts a family.<br /><br /><i>Gold: A Play in Four Acts</i> (1920)<br /><br />Interestingly, <i>Gold</i> seems like an expansion of an earlier O'Neill one-act, <i>Where the Cross is Made</i> (1918). He has recycled characters and stories like this with a couple of other plays, The Glencairin Quartet, Anna Christie and Chris Christopherson to name a few. These are people he has collected through his life, who live so vividly in his memory that he can just pick them up from one plot line and drop them into another, letting their personalities decide the action."

Known for her historical fiction, which won her the Nobel Prize for literature in 1928, Undset based this factual work on primary sources, her own experiences living in Italy, and her profound understanding of the human heart. One of the greatest novelists of the twentieth century, Undset was no stranger to hagiography. Her meticulous research of medieval times, which bore such fruit in her multi-volume masterpieces Kristin Lavransdatter and The Master of Hestviken, acquainted her with some of the holy men and women produced by the Age of Faith. Their exemplary lives left a lasting impression upon the author, an impression Undset credited as one of her reasons for entering the Church in 1924. Catherine of Siena was a particular favorite of Undset, who also was a Third Order Dominican. An extraordinarily active, intelligent, and courageous woman, Catherine at an early age devoted herself to the love of God. The intensity of her prayer, sacrifice, and service to the poor won her a reputation for holiness and wisdom, and she was called upon to make peace between warring nobles. Believing that peace in Italy could be achieved only if the Pope, then living in France, returned to Rome, Catherine boldly traveled to Avignon to meet with Pope Gregory XI. With sensitivity to the zealous love of God and man that permeated the life of Saint Catherine, Undset presents a most moving and memorable portrait of one of the greatest women of all time."

After falling into an affair with the married father of a would-be suitor, Jenny has a baby out-of- wedlock and decides to raise the child on her own. Undset’ s portrayal of a woman struggling toward independence and fulfillment is written with an unflinching, clear-eyed honesty that renders her story as compelling today as it was nearly a century ago.<br /><br /> This new translation by Tiina Nunnally captures the fresh, vivid style of Undset’s writing and restores passages omitted from the only previous edition to appear in English, which was published in 1921. Most famous for her later, historical fiction set in Catholic, medieval Scandinavia, Undset stands revealed with Jenny, her first major novel, as an unsparing, compassionate, magnificent realist, the creator of works that are at once thoroughly modern and of enduring interest."

Early in their marriage, she realizes that her charming husband is too irresponsible to support the family and sews dresses to make ends meet. When Frithjof becomes involved with another woman, Ida Elisabeth divorces him. The single mother moves with her children to a small town. Still young and good looking, the admirably hardworking Ida Elisabeth attracts the attention of a successful lawyer, who possesses the manly virtues that her husband lacked. As she contemplates marrying again, Frithjof, now gravely sick, reenters her life. Unlike Undset's famous historical novels, which are set in medieval Norway, the story of Ida Elisabeth unfolds in the 1920s. As in Undset's other fiction, however, Ida Elisabeth poignantly illustrates how poor choices affect the course of a person's life and how the suffering endured because of grievous mistakes can become the means by which a love is purified. Even in her historical novels, the Nobel Prize-winning Undset tackled contemporary themes. With its setting in modern times, Ida Elisabeth examines the difficulties inherent in male-female relationships as they are experienced in contemporary society. Undset's descriptions of the Norwegian people and countryside coupled with her profound understanding of the human heart won her worldwide literary acclaim. Both are powerfully displayed in this compelling drama about fidelity and forgiveness."

Set in Kristiania (now Oslo) at the beginning of the twentieth century, Undset’s book is an incomparable psychological portrait of a woman whose destiny is defined by the changing mores of her day—as she descends, inevitably, into an ever-darker reckoning. Remarkably, though Undset’s other works have attracted generations of readers, <i>Marta Oulie </i>has never before appeared in English translation.

The book includes two short stories, ""Simonsen"" and ""Tjodolf"", which capture the lives of people living in Christiana (now Oslo) in 1900; a novel, Jenny, which tells the story of a disenchanted painter; and an assortment of letters written between 1900 and 1922."

""Det var det enda vissa i hans liv, att han och Ingunn voro oupplösligt bundna vid varann och skulle följas åt."" Men när de har vuxit upp tycker omgivningen inte att det är lika självklart.<br /><br />Olavs och Ingunns livshistoria utspelas i en tid och en miljö - det slutande 1100-talets Norge - där motsättningar naturligt och av hävd utmynnar i våldsdåd men där också den unga kyrkan kraftfullt hävdar sin makt över den enskilde. Med samma betvingande inlevelse som i ""Kristin Lavransdotter"" återskapar Sigrid Undset här medeltidens oroliga och konfliktfyllda samhälle, och liksom i den tidigare romanen gestaltar hon människans eviga livsfrågor i pregnant tecknade individer. Olav Audunsson i Hästviken är en roman om skuld och försoning, obeveklig i sin klarsyn, befriande genom sin varma förståelse och medkänsla."

Marocco'],['3.40'],"Sono davvero felici i vent’anni, o è solo la nostalgia di un tempo in cui si aveva ancora “tutta la vita davanti” che ne mitizza il ricordo? Certo c’è dell’ironia nel titolo del romanzo che la venticinquenne Sigrid Undset pubblicò nel 1908 e che divenne subito quello che oggi si definirebbe un cult generazionale. Nell’irrequieta Uni Hirsh, nel suo bisogno di affermarsi e nella sua insoddisfazione, nella resa alla disperazione di Charlotte, nel senso di inadeguatezza di Birgit, i coetanei riconobbero i loro problemi, il loro linguaggio, i loro sogni e le loro disillusioni. Una generazione di giovani, soprattutto donne, che hanno studiato, hanno conquistato la possibilità di lavorare, di essere indipendenti, di seguire la propria vocazione, godono di una libertà finora inimmaginabile e che nello scontro con la realtà quotidiana scoprono di non avere in effetti alcuna prospettiva di uscire dal grigiore di quella vita piccolo borghese da cui volevano fuggire, dallo squallore delle camere d’affitto che i loro magri stipendi bastano a stento a pagare, dalla solitudine che legami occasionali non arrivano a infrangere, dall’insofferenza verso il loro ambiente, la loro famiglia, le loro madri che capiscono tutto, tranne l’essenziale, dalla noia di occupazioni in cui le loro capacità non vengono utilizzate, da una vita che chiede loro troppo poco e dà in cambio ancora meno. Sono solo i sogni che restano grandi: andare in America, come vorrebbe Kristian, scrivere, come Charlotte, diventare attrice, come Uni, l’unica che riesce davvero a realizzarlo, per scoprire che anche nel mondo del teatro resta un’estranea, insicura del proprio talento, con successi che vanno e vengono e non la compensano della perdita dell’unico amore. E quando rinuncia alla carriera per recuperarlo, per diventare moglie e madre, sarà comunque con la consapevolezza di avere sempre dentro di sé una nostalgia di altro che non sarà mai appagata. E’ il bisogno di intensità, di vivere “anche un solo istante con tutto il proprio essere”, la ricerca di felicità e la frustrazione di quell’età che segue l’adolescenza e la prolunga e che, con tutte le sue incertezze, le sue pretese, la sua esigenza di risposte immediate, resta forse la più tormentata e difficile."

Jenny (1911), an idealistic &amp; tragic love story, is one of the latter novels. Undset's comprehensive knowledge of medieval Scandinavian culture has its literary monuments in Kristin Lavransdatter ('20-22) &amp; The Master of Hestviken ('25-27), historical novels that depict life in the Norwegian Middle Ages. She was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in '28. Norwegian criticism of her writing centers on her religiosity (she became a conservative, almost reactionary Catholic in Lutheran Norway in the 20s; she possesses an intensity of belief that is rather naturally expressed in the medieval novels. Yet while she's written religious polemics, the medieval novels are not tendentious. In fact, the central motifs are eroticism, marriage &amp; family life, in short, the full life of a medieval woman who sees herself in the light of contemporary Christian beliefs. These novels are realistic delineations of medieval personalities. During WWII she escaped the German occupation of Norway &amp; fled to America, where she wrote her autobiographical Happy Times in Norway ('42)."

Editors Ia Dubois and Katherine Hanson (An Everyday Story: Norwegian Women's Fiction) have woven together a rich blend of classic and contemporary literature written for and about girls. Girls who dare to ski off high jumps, who build river dams, who scheme to get rich by selling imaginary lottery tickets. Girls who long for their parents to stop quarreling, for their mothers to act normal, for their fathers to understand them. Girls who ponder what to name themselves, how to find and keep a best friend, what their futures will be. Girls who are energetic, wild and breakers of rules. Girls who are thoughtful, astute and delightfully funny.Scandinavia has produced some of world literature's most enduring writing for and about children. Authors such as Tove Ditlevsen, Sigrid Undset, Cora Sandel and Gerd Brantenberg have created memorable portraits of girls coming of age, while Astrid Lindgren and Tove Jansson are famous world-wide for their charming books about Pippi Longstocking and the Moomin family. Although some of this literature is well-known in translation, Echo is the first time that many of these stories have been published in English. Each of the twenty-eight pieces comes with a brief introduction. With work from four countries -- Denmark, Finland, Sweden and Norway -- as well as minority voices of the Sami, gypsy and Jewish populations of Scandinavia, Echo is as comprehensive as it is refreshing."

Era innamorata di Gesù, la giovanissima regina irlandese del X secolo costretta a fuggire in Norvegia. Oggi la sede ufficiale del suo culto è Bergen, ma è l'affascinante isola di Selje il luogo dove lei approdò e lodò Dio fino al martirio. Pari per importanza ai più noti sant'Olav e sant'Halvard, questa santa che si nascose in una caverna all'arrivo dei pagani ha la grazia di giungere a noi per consegnarci il pathos immacolato di una trepidazione femminile che non conosce mode né epoche. Purezza per purezza, la cattolica novecentesca Undset doppiò la sua memoria, mirò alla quintessenza della descrizione del paesaggio nordico e di una parola fortemente pittorica pur di svelarci come in fondo la grande letteratura è la gemella oggi dimenticata dell'ascesi.<br />Se Kristin figlia di Lavrans è il capolavoro riconosciuto di Sigrid Undset, il successivo Santa Sunniva e gli uomini di Selje rappresenta la gemmazione di quell'affresco, il lucidissimo specchio di un alto medioevo – o di un'aurora boreale – dove ancora lampeggiano le nostre più vere emozioni."

Van deze romans is die over Olav Audunszoon minder bekend, maar daarom niet minder boeiend dan die over Kristin Lavransdochter. Het feit dat het in 1982 honderd jaar geleden is dat Sigrid Undset geboren werd, heeft er waarschijnlijk toe bijgedragen dat de al in 1930 in het Nederlands verschenen vertaling van de roman over Olav Audunszoon, wel in een gewijzigde spelling, nu in de Scandinavische reeks van Meulenhoff is opgenomen. Het verhaal over Olav en zijn geliefde Ingunn en over hun strijd tussen het eigen ik en de door het middeleeuwse katholieke geloof opgelegde plicht zal vele lezers blijven boeien, mede doordat het realistisch is beschreven en een cultuur-historisch rijk en betrouwbaar beeld geeft van het 13e eeuwse Scandinavië.<br /><br />In Olav Audunszoon schildert Sigrid Unset de ontluikende liefde tussen Olav, zoon van Augun, en Ingunn Steinfinnsdochter, de bezwaren die tegen deze verbintenis worden ingebracht en het plotselinge vertrek van Olav wanneer hij naar Denemarken moet vluchten. Ingunn blijft alleen achter en is afhankelijk van haar familie. Dit was in die tijd een slechte situatie, bijna als van een in de steek gelaten meisje, een vrouw zonder rechten overgeleverd aan de welwillendheid van haar familie. Even voor Olav terugkeert - even plotseling als hij vertrokken is - wordt Ingunn verleid door een amoureuze IJslander. Op prachtige wijze verteld Sigrid Undset de moeite, die het Olav kost om dit kind van een ander als zijn zoon te accepteren, de moord op de IJslander die nooit wordt opgelost en ook Olavs eigen ontrouw met de vurige Thornhild Björnsdochter.<br /><br />In deze uitgave zijn de volgende delen te vinden: Olav Audunszoon treedt in het huwelijk ~ Ingunn Steinfinnsdochter ~ Olav Audunszoons geluk."

Eppure lo spirito di una presenza divina, nella natura attorno, non resta certo indifferente...<br />È l'altro Novecento, quello della Undset – non mirante a laicizzare il linguaggio e a infrangere forme, secondo i dettami delle avanguardie, di James Joyce e Virginia Woolf. Al contrario, alla scrittrice riuscì di trasportare dai romanzi medioevali all'agiografia il pregnante stile della saga, come attestò l'indimenticabile studiosa Lodovica Koch.<br />Per la Undset, convertitasi al cattolicesimo nel 1924, anno precedente la pubblicazione di Sant'Halvard, lo spirito, il mondo di Dio, è essenzialmente realismo, percezione non dimidiata della complessità e della pienezza della vita, trepidante ascolto del mistero e intrepido rifiuto delle rimozioni. È bagnata da una luce di grazia, la scrittura vichinga della Undset: quella letteratura e quel popolo, finalmente sono redenti...<br />Perché infine è questo il messaggio che lancia sant'Halvard, dal Medioevo fino a noi: in un'Europa consumata dalle dissacrazioni, ancor di più arde la vita della Croce."

Один из романов принадлежит перу лауреата Нобелевской премии норвежки Сигрид Унсет (1882 - 1949), а второй - продолжательнице традиций знаменитой соотечественницы, Вере Хенриксен. Очерк ""Тигры моря"" поможет читателям составлять полное представление о мире материальной культуры норманнов. <br />Роман «Сага о Вигдис и Вига-Льоте. Девы битв» из серии «Викинги» принадлежит перу знаменитой норвежской писательницы Сигрид Унсет. Около 17 произведений этого автора были переведены на русский язык, среди них книги «Любовь отзвучала», «Обездоленные», «Крест» и другие.<br /><br />В центре романа «Сага о Вигдис и Вига-Льоте. Девы битв» находится скандинавская женщина. В книге вы найдете описание ее судьбы и роли в средневековом обществе. Ранний период творчества писательницы отличает позиционирование женщины как хранительницы очага, что в полной мере нашло свое отражение и в настоящей книге – удивительно точном повествовании."

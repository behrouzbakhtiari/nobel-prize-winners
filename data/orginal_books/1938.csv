Centering her story around the fictional family of Ling Tan, Buck recreates the heart wrenching devastation that war inflicted on these gentle innocent people. Ling Tan and his family were simple farmers living in peaceful isolation. Western technology, and likewise the machinery of war, were unknown in these outlying regions of China. And even though literacy was on the rise among the younger generations, the alarming reports of foreign aggression went largely ignored. For the peasants, the transition from one political ruler to another was virtually inconsequential; life revolved around their farms and their villages. Patriotism was not the concept of loving and defending a country; their land was their country. But as the invasion moves inland and the roads are jammed with survivors fleeing west, Ling Tan and his neighbors are forced to face the harsh realities of war. ""Days passed and with the rulers gone the people held themselves the more steadfast knowing that they and they alone were left to stand against the enemy and upon each man himself now depended what would happen. So it had happened again and again in other times, for rulers anywhere are always the first to fly, and the people must stay behind to be steadfast."

Over the years, her racist feelings and fears only intensify, and when it’s time for her own daughter to marry, her chief concern is the color of the children.<br /> <br /><i>The Angry Wife</i> is a memorable and impassioned dissection of prejudice, as well as a riveting portrait of post­–Civil War America."

Susan Gaylord is talented, loving, equipped with a strong moral sense, and adept at anything she puts her hand to, from housework to playing the piano to working with marble and clay. But the intensity of her artistic calling comes at a price, isolating her from other people—at times, even from her own family. When her husband dies and she remarries, she finds herself once again comparing the sacrifice of solitude to that of commitment. With a heroine who is naturalistic yet compellingly larger than life, This Proud Heart is incomparable in its sympathetic study of character. <br /> <br />This ebook features an illustrated biography of Pearl S.

At first he and his wife cannot decide what they should do with him.

The surgery is successful, and the couple settle into a period of hope and fear as they await the patient’s recovery.

The story is told through the eyes of one who comes on the scene as a stranger first to observe, then to participate, but he remains forever amazed. He is Henry Potter, a wealthy New York industrialist. Addicted to theatergoing, but disliking with growing intensity what seems to him drivel on the stage, he determines to back a play of his own choosing. The decision takes over his life like a devouring monster, involving him with individuals who both fascinate and repel him. The triangle of Elena, the amoral star of the play; Aubrey, the young director; and Stella, Aubrey's wife, enmeshes him almost beyond escape."""

  <i>.</i>
</b><br />  <br /> In 1938, Pearl S. Buck became the first woman to win a Nobel Prize in Literature for <i>The Good Earth</i>, which had already earned her the Pulitzer Prize. Upon choosing Buck’s novel for her book club in 2004, Oprah Winfrey said: “Reading Pearl Buck’s writing feels like reading poetry to me. I just love the quiet rhythm of the words. They evoke the simple beauty of the characters and the harsh mystery of China’s ancient culture.” The daughter of missionaries, the <i>New York Times</i>–bestselling author would continue to explore many aspect of Chinese culture in her work, and the three novels collected in this volume represent some of her most compassionate and revealing fiction.<br />  <br /><i>Pavilion of Women</i>: This “vivid and extremely interesting novel,” set in early twentieth-century China, follows an upper-class wife’s quest for personal freedom (<i>The New Yorker</i>). After Madame Wu turns forty, she encourages her husband to take a young concubine so she can finally begin to discover her own mind—and a new world opens up before her as she reads forbidden books and studies English with a progressive former priest.<br />  <br /> “Beautifully written . . . A fine, full flavorsome novel.” —<i>Newsweek</i><br />  <br /><i>Peony</i>: A young Chinese bondmaid in nineteenth-century China falls in love with the son of the wealthy Jewish family she works for. As the couple’s traditions collide, their relationship faces opposition from every side.<br />  <br /> “<i>Peony</i> has the vividness of scene and episode and character and the colorful detail that [Buck’s] readers have come to expect of her novels in China.” —<i>New York Herald Tribune</i><br />  <br /><i>Imperial Woman</i>: In this “richly woven . . . quite absorbing” <i>New York Times</i> bestseller, Buck brings to life the story of Tzu Hsi, the magnetic and fierce-minded woman who rose from concubine to become the working head of the Qing Dynasty and the last empress of China for nearly half a century (<i>The Nation</i>)<i>.</i><br />  <br /> “Certainly, no fictioneer could imagine a more incredible woman. . . . Pearl Buck has done a remarkable and painstaking job in recreating her.” —<i>Saturday Review</i>"

Fiabe e racconti sono basati sulle reminiscenze dei molti Natali trascorsi dall'Autrice sia in Cina sia in America. Non importa che l'albero sia il bell'abete della tradizione americana o un esile bambù cinese; che il maestoso tacchino arrosto sia sostituito da un'oca selvatica; o anche che non vi sia niente di tutto questo. Ciò che conta è la poesia, lo spirito del Natale, il momento magico in cui ogni essere umano, solo con se stesso e con i suoi ricordi, sente il bisogno di dare e ricevere amore, solidarietà, comprensione. E anche qui Pearl Buck proclama e ripete quelle che sono le sue convinzioni fondamentali: la fratellanza fra gli uomini, quale che sia il colore della loro pelle; l'imperativo di proteggere i bambini innocenti dalle ingiustizie e dai pregiudizi del mondo; la necessità che i popoli della terra non siano travagliati dalle guerre. ? un?esortazione all?amore e alla fede, rivolta a tutti gli uomini di buona volont?."

His father could only afford a few animals and the circus travelled only the smallest of India's towns where the people were the most easily impressed. Raj was their most ferocious looking but cuddlesome tiger and their leopard was Meera, who was gentle and aging. Their story is the expansion of an incident the author witnessed in India. The money the circus needs will be supplied in abundance if only Ranjit and his father can get their animals into character for a movie company. They need a scene where a tiger and a leopard fight. Ranjit's efforts to help his frantic father to get the cats moving is recounted with pointed humor about people, animals and movie making."

A szegény parasztember, Vang Lung élete tele van viszontagságokkal, kemény munkával keresi meg a mindennapi betevőjét, s bár sokat nélkülözik, mégis mindenek felett szereti a földjét. Egy napon kincsre lel, s ez egy csapásra megváltoztatja az életét. A szegény emberből gazdag földbirtokos lesz. De vajon a gazdagsággal együtt jár a boldogság is? A regény betekintést nyújt a száz évvel ezelőtti Kína vidéki életébe és egy hanyatlásnak indult arisztokrata család végnapjaiba. Ám a könyv igazi ereje abban rejlik, hogy az emberi élet jelentőségét és tragédiáját vetíti elénk, amit a földkerekség minden részében és minden idejében átélt és át is él az emberiség. Pearl S. Buck e regénye 1938-ban irodalmi Nobel-díjat és Pulitzer-díjat kapott. A kötet a 40-es években jelent meg először magyarul, Az édes anyaföld címmel. Ezúttal új fordításban, hiánytalan tartalommal élvezheti az olvasó."

Buck, this beautiful gift book allows readers of all ages to share a heartwarming story about awakening the simple joy of Christmas.<br /><br /> Remembering a special Christmas from his childhood, Rob wants to get his father a Christmas gift that would truly show his love and appreciation. But it’s Christmas Eve, and living on a farm far away from stores limits his options. He knows the best gifts aren’t necessarily purchased but come from the heart. Suddenly, Rob has an idea, one that will require him to get up very early, before four o’clock, to milk the cows so his father won’t have to.<br /><br /> Fifty years have passed since that special Christmas morning, and Rob wants to feel that true joy of Christmas again. With his children grown and the house empty, Rob thinks of his wife and feels an overwhelming need to show his appreciation to her. But it’s early Christmas morning. What gift could he give to express his love for her and revive their joy?<br /><br /> This adaptation of <i>Christmas Day in the Morning</i> features beautifully designed pages and festive imagery throughout the book.<br />  <br />"

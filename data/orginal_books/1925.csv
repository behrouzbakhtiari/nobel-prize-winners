An updated and considerably revised version of the ancient Greek legend of Pygmalion and Galatea, the 20th-century story pokes fun at the antiquated British class system. <br /><br />In Shaw's clever adaptation, Professor Henry Higgins, a linguistic expert, takes on a bet that he can transform an awkward cockney flower seller into a refined young lady simply by polishing her manners and changing the way she speaks. In the process of convincing society that his creation is a mysterious royal figure, the Professor also falls in love with his elegant handiwork.<br /><br />The irresistible theme of the emerging butterfly, together with Shaw's brilliant dialogue and splendid skills as a playwright, have made Pygmalion one of the most popular comedies in the English language. A staple of college drama courses, it is still widely performed."

The scene in which Eliza appears in high society with the correct accent but no notion of polite conversation is considered one of the funniest in English drama. Like most of Shaw’s work, <i>Pygmalion</i> wins over audiences with wit, a taut morality, and an innate understanding of human relationships.<br /><br />This volume also includes <i>Major Barbara</i>, which attacks both capitalism and charitable organizations, <i>The Doctor’s Dilemma</i>, a keen-eyed examination of medical morals and malpractice, and <i>Heartbreak House</i>, which exposes the spiritual bankruptcy of the generation responsible for the bloodshed of World War I.<br /><br /><b>John A.

In this powerful drama of ideas, Shaw explores the role of the artist, the function of women in society, and his theory of Creative Evolution.

She is not a prepossessing woman. No woman looks her best after sitting up all night; and Mrs. Dudgeon's face, even at its best, is grimly trenched by the channels into which the barren forms and observances of a dead Puritanism can pen a bitter temper and a fierce pride. She is an elderly matron who has worked hard and got nothing by it except dominion and detestation in her sordid home, and an unquestioned reputation for piety and respectability among her neighbors, to whom drink and debauchery are still so much more tempting than religion and rectitude, that they conceive goodness simply as self-denial. This conception is easily extended to others - denial, and finally generalized as covering anything disagreeable. So Mrs. Dudgeon, being exceedingly disagreeable, is held to be excee-dingly good. Short of flat felony, she enjoys complete license except for amiable weaknesses of any sort, and is consequently, without knowing it, the most licentious woman in the parish on the strength of never having broken the seventh commandment or missed a Sunday at the Presbyterian church."

Journeying through the forest, she encounters various religious figures, each one seeking to convert her to their own brand of faith.

""Don Juan in Hell"" showcases the master's art at its best.<br />An episode from Act Three of <i>Man and Superman,</i> ""Don Juan in Hell"" is often presented independently of the rest of the play. Rooted in the Don Juan legend — particularly as it appears in Mozart's opera <i>Don Giovanni </i>— this dream sequence forms a play within a play. It consists of a dramatic reading in which three characters from <i>Man and Superman</i> appear in archetypal guises: Don Juan, the libertine turned moralist; Doña Ana, the eternal female; and the Commander, a hypocrite transformed into a statue. The Devil himself joins their spirited debate on the nature of heaven and hell, of good and evil, and of human purpose, for a captivating blend of Shavian wit and Nietzschean philosophy."

Set during the American War of Independence, The Devil's Disciple exposes fake Puritanism and piety, while Caesar and Cleopatra, a cheeky riposte to Shakespeare, redefines heroism in the character of the ageing Roman leader.

He was the most influential member of the aristocratic Tolstoy family. His first publications were three autobiographical novels, Childhood, Boyhood, and Youth (1852-1856). They tell of a rich landowner's son and his slow realization of the differences between him and his peasants. As a fiction writer Tolstoy is widely regarded as one of the greatest of all novelists, particularly noted for his masterpieces War and Peace (1869) and Anna Karenina (1877). In their scope, breadth and realistic depiction of 19th-century Russian life, the two books stand at the peak of realist fiction. As a moral philosopher Tolstoy was notable for his ideas on nonviolent resistance through works such as The Kingdom of God is Within You (1894). During his life, Tolstoy came to the conclusion that William Shakespeare is a bad dramatist and not a true artist at all. Tolstoy explained his views in a critical essay on Shakespeare written in 1903."

Based on historical people and real events, Miller's drama is a searing portrait of a community engulfed by hysteria. In the rigid theocracy of Salem, rumors that women are practicing witchcraft galvanize the town's most basic fears and suspicions; and when a young girl accuses Elizabeth Proctor of being a witch, self-righteous church leaders and townspeople insist that Elizabeth be brought to trial. The ruthlessness of the prosecutors and the eagerness of neighbor to testify against neighbor brilliantly illuminate the destructive power of socially sanctioned violence. Written in 1953, <b>The Crucible</b> is a mirror Miller uses to reflect the anti-communist hysteria inspired by Senator Joseph McCarthy's ""witch-hunts"" in the United States. Within the text itself, Miller contemplates the parallels, writing ""Political opposition...is given an inhumane overlay, which then justifies the abrogation of all normally applied customs of civilized behavior. A political policy is equated with moral right, and opposition to it with diabolical malevolence.""

Born in Dublin, he moved to London when he turned twenty. Having rejected formal schooling, he educated himself by independent study in the reading room of the British Museum; he also began his career there by writing novels for which he could not find a publisher. His first success was as a music and literary critic, but he was drawn to drama and authored more than sixty plays during his career. Typically his work is leavened by a delightful vein of comedy, but nearly all of it bears earnest messages Shaw hoped his audiences would embrace. He remains the only person to have been awarded both a Nobel Prize (1925) for his contribution to literature and an Oscar (1938) for Pygmalion. Among his most famous works are: Candida (1894), Arms and the Man (1894) and Man and Superman (1902-03)."

Although his plays focus on ideas and issues, they are enlivened by fascinating characters, a brilliant command of language, and dazzling wit.<br /><br />One of Shaw’s finest and most devilish comedies, <em>Man and Superman</em> portrays Don Juan as the quarry instead of the huntsman. John Tanner, upon discovering that his beautiful ward plans to marry him, flees to the Sierra Nevada mountain range, where he is captured by a group of rebels. Tanner falls asleep, and dreams the famous “Don Juan in Hell” sequence, which features a sparkling Shavian debate among Don Juan, the Devil, and a talkative statue. With its fairy-tale ending and a cast literally from hell, Man and Superman is a hilarious cocktail of farce, Nietzschean philosophy, and Mozart’s <em>Don Giovanni</em>.<br /><br />Also included in this volume are <em>Candida</em>, Shaw’s first real success on the stage, <em>Mrs. Warren’s Profession</em>, which poked fun at the Victorian attitude toward prostitution, and <em>The Devil’s Disciple</em>, a play set during the American Revolution."

There are two ways of taking prison, as of taking most things, and all the myriad ways between these two extremes; would Oscar be conquered by it and allow remorse and hatred to corrupt his very heart, or would he conquer the prison and possess and use it? Hammer or anvil-which? Victory has its virtue and is justified of itself like sunshine; defeat carries its own condemnation. Yet we have all tasted its bitter waters: only ""infinite virtue"" can pass through life victorious, Shakespeare tells us, and we mortals are not of infinite virtue. The myriad vicissitudes of the struggle search out all our weaknesses; test all our powers. Every victory shows a more difficult height to scale, a steeper pinnacle of god-like hardship-that's the reward of victory: it provides the hero with ever-new battle-fields: no rest for him this side the grave."

But its lesson is not, I am sorry to say, unneeded. Mere morality, or the substitution of custom for conscience was once accounted a shameful and cynical thing: people talked of right and wrong, of honor and dishonor, of sin and grace, of salvation and damnation, not of morality and immorality. The word morality, if we met it in the Bible, would surprise us as much as the word telephone or motor car. Nowadays we do not seem to know that there is any other test of conduct except morality; and the result is that the young had better have their souls awakened by disgrace, capture by the police, and a month's hard labor, than drift along from their cradles to their graves doing what other people do for no other reason than that other people do it, and knowing nothing of good and evil, of courage and cowardice, or indeed anything but how to keep hunger and concupiscence and fashionable dressing within the bounds of good taste except when their excesses can be concealed. Is it any wonder that I am driven to offer to young people in our suburbs the desperate advice: Do something that will get you into trouble? But please do not suppose that I defend a state of things which makes such advice the best that can be given under the circumstances, or that I do not know how difficult it is to find out a way of getting into trouble that will combine loss of respectability with integrity of self-respect and reasonable consideration for other peoples' feelings and interests on everypoint except their dread of losing their own respectability."

Both men were intristic dramatists who shared a rich and abiding respect for the stage. Shakespeare was the produce of a tempestuous and enlightening era under the reign of his patron, Queen Elizabeth I; while G.B.S. reflected the racy and risque spirt of the late 19th century as the champion of modern drama by playwrights like Ibsen, and, later, himself. Culled from Shaw's reviews, prefaces, letters to actors and critics, and other writings, SHAW ON SHAKESPEARE offers a fascinating and unforgettable portrait of the 16th century playwright by his most outspoken critic. This is a witty and provocative classic that combines Shaw's prodigious critical acumen with a superlative prose style second to none (except, perhaps, Shakespeare!)."

Born in Dublin, he moved to London when he turned twenty. Having rejected formal schooling, he educated himself by independent study in the reading room of the British Museum; he also began his career there by writing novels for which he could not find a publisher. His first success was as a music and literary critic, but he was drawn to drama and authored more than sixty plays during his career. Typically his work is leavened by a delightful vein of comedy, but nearly all of it bears earnest messages Shaw hoped his audiences would embrace. He remains the only person to have been awarded both a Nobel Prize (1925) for his contribution to literature and an Oscar (1938) for Pygmalion. Among his most famous works are: Candida (1894), Arms and the Man (1894) and Man and Superman (1902-03)."

A superb repertory company has been assembled for these recordings, joined by distinguished guest artists F. Murray Abraham, John Glover, Rosemary Harris, Lois Nettleton, Barry Morse, Fritz Weaver—all under the direction of veteran producer Yuri Rasovsky, who has won both the Audie Award for book production and the George Foster Peabody Award for broadcasting. <p>These are not mere readings. Rather, they are full performances using all the resources of audio to full advantage. Just as stage plays are ""opened up"" when adapted to film, so these selections create greater intimacy. ""Staginess"" is avoided, lively theatrics enhanced, while the substance of the works remains intact. For instance, in <i>Arms and the Man</i>, audio makes possible the judicious integration of the author's witty scene settings, written for the published version of the play, with the play itself. This is the play that established Shaw's reputation as one of the greatest wits of the London drama scene. </p><p>Music accounts for another noteworthy aspect of these productions. <i>The Imaginary Invalid</i> employs the score that Marc-Antoine Charpentier composed for Molière's own premiere. It is conducted by Steven Ovitsky, artistic director of the Milwaukee Symphony. </p><p><i>The Tempest</i>, composed by Shakespeare as a multisensory theater experience, features music on Elizabethan instruments still extant from Shakespeare's own production, resulting in lyrical textual passages, overflowing with exotic images,tantalizing sounds, and a palpable lushness. </p><p>To ensure fidelity to the themes, atmosphere, and tone of the texts, three noted scholars from Tufts University served as advisors: Professors Peter Arnott, Sylvan Barnet, and Laurence Senelick. </p><p>All seven plays were taped with a repertory company in New York during the spring of 1985 and finished in Chicago. </p><p>Euripides - <i>Medea</i> <br />Shakespeare - <i>The Tempest</i> <br />Molière - <i>The Imaginary Invalid</i> <br />Dumas - <i>Camille</i> <br />Ibsen - <i>An Enemy of the People</i> <br />Shaw - <i>Arms and the Man</i> <br />Chekhov - <i>Uncle Vanya *</i> </p><p>directed and produced by Yuri Rasovsky </p><p>""<i>Rasovsky's directorial genius lies in his orchestration of passion and restraint</i>."" —Variety </p><p>""<i>Yuri Rasovsky—who wrote and produced this superior experience--must be a genius</i>."" —AudioFile Magazine </p><p>""<i>Classic Plays is what audio theater ought to be. Rasovsky proves he is an audio showman and this is a showcase for his great talents. These spoken works function so well in the audio medium with the scholarly manuscripts, astonishing period music and the sumptuous cast. Such names as John Glover, Fritz Weaver, Barry Morse, F. Murray Abraham lends their voices to these classic achievements. Those who currently say there are DREK in the audio marketplace, needs to have our teenage children be exposed to these pieces of audio history. Yuri, you did good!

Среди них самая знаменитая - ""Пигмалион"" (1912 г.), по которой снято множество фильмов и поставлен легендарный бродвейский мюзикл ""Моя прекрасная леди"". В основе сюжета - древнегреческий миф о том, как скульптор старается оживить созданную им прекрасную статую. А герой пьесы Шоу из простой цветочницы за 6 месяцев пытается сделать утонченную аристократку. """"Пигмалион"" - это насмешка над поклонниками ""голубой крови""… каждая моя пьеса была камнем, который я бросал в окна викторианского благополучия"", - говорил Шоу. В 1977 г. по этой пьесе был поставлен фильм-балет с Е. Максимовой и М. Лиепой. ""Пигмалион"" и сейчас с успехом идет в театрах всего мира. .Также в издание включены пьеса ""Кандида"" (1895 г.) - о том непонятном и загадочном, не поддающемся рациональному объяснению, за что женщина может любить мужчину; и ""Смуглая леди сонетов"" (1910 г.) - своеобразная инсценировка скрытого сюжета шекспировских сонетов. . ."

As a cofounder of the Fabian society, an equal rights campaigner, and an ardent socialist, Shaw was never known to shy away from controversy, and was accused of treason for the 1914 publication <i>Common Sense About the War</i>, in which he affront patriots and the government alike. His vehemently anti-war stance was almost prophetic in its progressive nature, and holds particular resonance in today's climate of unrest."

It was first published in 1934. ""The Black Girl In Search Of God"" is a short story that follows a young girl who is newly converted to Christianity - and who embarks on a literal search for God. On her way, she comes into contact with a number of religious figures, each trying to convert her to their own faiths. This wonderfully sardonic allegory highlights Shaw's unorthodox ideas on faith and race, and was highly controversial when first published. George Bernard Shaw (1856 - 1950) was an Irish playwright who co-founded of the London School of Economics. Many vintage texts such as this are increasingly scarce and expensive, and it is with this in mind that we are republishing this book now, in an affordable, high-quality, modern edition. It comes complete with a specially commissioned biography of the author."

As the collective title indicates, the themes here are political; yet, frankly, it is doubtful how seriously we can now take Shaw as a political thinker. Despite writing in the 1930s, he has little to say of the nature of totalitarianism: although he satirises Fascist dictators in “Geneva”, the satire is disappointingly mild. Neither did Shaw appear to foresee (on the evidence of these plays, at least) the imminent collapse of the British Empire.But it is Shaw the dramatist rather than Shaw the political philosopher who still holds our attention – even in plays as explicitly political as these. He had a sharp intellect and a quirky sense of humour, and his dialogue still glints and sparkles: he couldn’t write a dull line if he tried. No matter how serious the themes he addresses, the crispness of his writing and his lightness of touch still scintillate.Shaw seems, perhaps unfairly, out of fashion nowadays. But even in these lesser-known works, he demonstrates his matchless ability, still undimmed, to provoke and to entertain."

In his youth he became an ardent socialist and wrote five novels, which are still very entertaining, although Shaw truly found his creative identity on the stage and lectern. While he was a great dramatist, it is possible to argue that Shaw's prefaces are better than his plays. Certainly they are masterful expositions of his ideas, and among the finest essays in English. If there is one defining virtue in Shaw, it is his ability to ask awkward questions. He was not someone who accepted the status quo; instead he spent the whole of his very long life in search of something better, as wit, critic, curmudgeon, and revolutionary. Among his greatest plays are CAESAR AND CLEOPATRA, MAN AND SUPERMAN, BACK TO METHUSELAH, SAINT JOAN, MAJORA BARBARA, PYGMALION (the basis for the musical -- and film -- MY FAIR LADY), and ANDROCLES AND THE LION. He wrote voluminously on social and political issues. His THE INTELLIGENT WOMAN'S GUIDE TO SOCIALISM (1928) was enormously popular at the time. He continued to publish until nearly the end of his life. Among his last works are SIXTEEN SELF-SKETCHES (1948), BOUYANT BILLIONS (1948) and FAR-FETCHED FABLES (1950)."

The English have no respect for their language, and will not teach their children to speak it. They spell it so abominably that no man can teach himself what it sounds like. It is impossible for an Englishman to open his mouth without making some other Englishman hate or despise him. German and Spanish are accessible to foreigners: English is not accessible even to Englishmen. The reformer England needs today is an energetic phonetic enthusiast: that is why I have made such a one the hero of a popular play. There have been heroes of that kind crying in the wilderness for many years past. When I became interested in the subject towards the end of the eighteen-seventies, Melville Bell was dead; but Alexander J. Ellis was still a living patriarch, with an impressive head always covered by a velvet skull cap, for which he would apologize to public meetings in a very courtly manner. He and Tito Pagliardini, another phonetic veteran, were men whom it was impossible to dislike. Henry Sweet, then a young man, lacked their sweetness of character: he was about as conciliatory to conventional mortals as Ibsen or Samuel Butler. His great ability as a phonetician (he was, I think, the best of them all at his job) would have entitled him to high official recognition, and perhaps enabled him to popularize his subject, but for his Satanic contempt for all academic dignitaries and persons in general who thought more of Greek than of phonetics. Once, in the days when the Imperial Institute rose in South Kensington, and Joseph Chamberlain was booming the Empire, I induced the editor of a leading monthly review to commission an article from Sweet on the imperial importance of his subject. When it arrived, it contained nothing but a savagely derisive attack on a professor of language and literature whose chair Sweet regarded as proper to a phonetic expert only. The article, being libelous, had to be returned as impossible; and I had to renounce my dream of dragging its author into the limelight. When I met him afterwards, for the first time for many years, I found to my astonishment that he, who had been a quite tolerably presentable young man, had actually managed by sheer scorn to alter his personal appearance until he had become a sort of walking repudiation of Oxford and all its traditions. It must have been largely in his own despite that he was squeezed into something called a Readership of phonetics there. The future of phonetics rests probably with his pupils, who all swore by him; but nothing could bring the man himself into any sort of compliance with the university, to which he nevertheless clung by divine right in an intensely Oxonian way. I daresay his papers, if he has left any, include some satires that may be published without too destructive results fifty years hence. He was, I believe, not in the least an ill-natured man: very much the opposite, I should say; but he would not suffer fools gladly."

They are also often warm, good-natured, playful, and generous - reflecting a fundamental mutual respect and similarity of outlook, however contrasting the temperament and style. The great majority of the two writers' correspondence is published here for the first time.<br /><br />This volumes comprises the personal correspondence of Shaw and Wells through the course of their friendship of more than forty years, and includes and introductory essay by J. Percy Smith. The letters are fully annotated, and are accompanied by information about the circumstances under which each was written, to enable the reader to follow the course of the frequently tempestuous relationship."

Fosse defendendo a música de Wagner e o teatro de Ibsen, fosse contestando a obra de Shakespeare e as ""ilusões do socialismo"", ele combinou lucidez e coragem com um agudo senso de provocação."

The fifteen years have made me older and graver. In you I can detect no such becoming change. Your levities and audacities are like the loves and comforts prayed for by Desdemona: they increase, even as your days do grow. No mere pioneering journal dares meddle with them now: the stately Times itself is alone sufficiently above suspicion to act as your chaperone; and even the Times must sometimes thank its stars that new plays are not produced every day, since after each such event its gravity is compromised, its platitude turned to epigram, its portentousness to wit, its propriety to elegance, and even its decorum into naughtiness by criticisms which the traditions of the paper do not allow you to sign at the end, but which you take care to sign with the most extravagant flourishes between the lines. I am not sure that this is not a portent of Revolution. In eighteenth century France the end was at hand when men bought the Encyclopedia and found Diderot there. When I buy the Times and find you there, my prophetic ear catches a rattle of twentieth century tumbrils."

Taken in combination, his essays aim to provide a representative cross-section of English theatre history in the late-nineteenth century. The first chapter explores Shaw's skill as a critic, highlighting his extraordinary body of knowledge. The rest of the essays deal with such playwrights as Shakespeare, Ibsen, Wilde, and Pinero; and such players as Irving, Ellen Terry, Mrs. Patrick Campbell, Forbes-Robertson, and Bernhardt. This text is highly recommended for those with a keen interest in theatre history, and it is not to be missed by the discerning collector of antiquarian literature of this ilk.

Visit us online at <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.1stWorldLibrary.ORG"" rel=""nofollow"">www.1stWorldLibrary.ORG</a> - - At the most wretched hour between a black night and a wintry morning in the year 1777, Mrs. Dudgeon, of New Hampshire, is sitting up in the kitchen and general dwelling room of her farm house on the outskirts of the town of Websterbridge. She is not a prepossessing woman. No woman looks her best after sitting up all night; and Mrs. Dudgeon's face, even at its best, is grimly trenched by the channels into which the barren forms and observances of a dead Puritanism can pen a bitter temper and a fierce pride. She is an elderly matron who has worked hard and got nothing by it except dominion and detestation in her sordid home, and an unquestioned reputation for piety and respectability among her neighbors, to whom drink and debauchery are still so much more tempting than religion and rectitude, that they conceive goodness simply as self-denial. This conception is easily extended to others - denial, and finally generalized as covering anything disagreeable. So Mrs. Dudgeon, being exceedingly disagreeable, is held to be excee-dingly good. Short of flat felony, she enjoys complete license except for amiable weaknesses of any sort, and is consequently, without knowing it, the most licentious woman in the parish on the strength of never having broken the seventh commandment or missed a Sunday at the Presbyterian church."

Here Tyson collects seventy-three of the best remaining literary book reviews written by Shaw throughout his lifetime. Two-thirds of the reviews appear in book form for the first time, the originals residing in the archives of newspaper libraries, and only three of the remainder have been reprinted within the last twenty years. Politics feature largely in the works that Shaw reviewed: there are books of socialist theory and its practical appearance in the Soviet Union, as well as books on the individualism of J. H. Levy, the anti-socialism of Thomas McKay, and the economics of E. C. K. Gonner and Philip Wicksteed. There is often an immediacy about the books reviewed, too: discussion of books on World War I, the Soviet Revolution, women's suffrage, the British General Strike of 1926, and World War II all take place concurrently with the events. Many of the works reviewed are biographies, which give Shaw the opportunity to reveal his personal acquaintance with their subjects, including Samuel Butler, William Morris, and Dean Inge.<br /><br />This widely varied collection sparkles with wit and wisdom, taking us briskly through Shaw's own writing life, beginning when he was relatively unknown and concluding when he was a legend."

The Times was a powerful medium not just in England but throughout the empire and in its heyday the views aired in the main articles and the letters columns were heeded and discussed. From his first letter in 1898, Shaw was endeavouring to gain acceptance in the columns of The Times in a way that was distinct from his other personae of critic, socialist, and playwright. Shaw took on the world of scholars, politicians, critics, and the medical profession. He offered advice on economics to different Chancellors and got involved in the campaign for women's rights and the letters range over a wide variety of subjects that include Art, Music, Theatre, Language, Phonetics, Politics, Medicine, Economics, and Women's Rights. He became an icon who was labelled by Bertrand Russell as an iconoclast. This book is a collection of five decades of Shaw's letters."

Midsummer night on the terrace of the Palace at Whitehall, overlooking the Thames. The Palace clock chimes four quarters and strikes eleven.""The Man arrives at Whitehall where he meets a Beefeater guard. He persuades the Beefeater to allow him to stay to meet his girlfriend, a lady of the court, who will be arriving soon for a secret tryst. The Man notes down various interesting phrases used by the Beefeater (all quotations from Shakespeare plays). The Lady arrives, cloaked, but it is not the woman he is expecting. The Man immediately falls for her. While also noting down her own interesting expressions in his notebook, he tells her how beautiful and desirable she is. The Dark Lady arrives, and is shocked to see her lover attempting to seduce another woman. She tells The Lady not to trust The Man, as he is a mere actor. She then recognises that The Lady is Queen Elizabeth. The Man reveals that he is William Shakespeare. The Queen demands that he should apologise to her, but Shakespeare insists that his family is more respectable than hers, and that she only has her job by accident of birth. The Dark Lady is shocked by Shakespeare's frankness, but the queen forgives him. Shakespeare complains that his worst plays, As You Like It and Much Ado About Nothing, are the most popular, but is most proud of the ones with intelligent female characters, such All's Well that End's Well. If the queen would establish a National Theatre, he could create more of the kind of plays he wants to, rather than those that please the public. The queen says she'll look into it, but does not think the idea will please her Treasurer. She thinks it will probably be another 300 years before the idea will gain widespread support. She upbraids the Beefeater for allowing Shakespeare into the palace grounds, and tells him to make sure that Shakespeare leaves."

Kring förra sekelskiftet lade tidens två skarpaste pennor, Oscar Wilde och George Bernard Shaw, fram varsin teori i essäns öppna och generösa form. I det långa företalet till sin pjäs ”The Dark Lady of the Sonnets” (1910) diskuterar Shaw vem den mörka dam som de senare sonetterna är riktad till kan ha varit, medan Wilde i sin novellartade ”The Portrait of Mr W. H.” (1891) spekulerar över identiteten av den unge man som dikterna är dedicerade till, och som den större delen av dem tycks handla om. De två spirituella texterna, plus Shaws pjäs, har översatts av Ulf Liljedahl och nu för första gången sammanförts i bokform under titeln Shakespeares älskade. Teddy Brunius har försett volymen med ett efterord."

Although his first profitable writing was music and literary criticism, in which capacity he wrote many highly articulate pieces of journalism, his main talent was for drama, and he wrote more than 60 plays. He was also an essayist, novelist and short story writer. Nearly all his writings address prevailing social problems, but have a vein of comedy which makes their stark themes more palatable. Issues which engaged Shaw's attention included education, marriage, religion, government, health care, and class privilege. He is the only person to have been awarded both a Nobel Prize in Literature (1925) and an Oscar (1938), for his contributions to literature and for his work on the film Pygmalion (adaptation of his play of the same name), respectively In this book: Pygmalion Arms and the Man Mrs. Warren's Profession Major Barbara Man And Superman Caesar and Cleopatra Heartbreak House You Never Can Tell Getting Married The Devil's Disciple The Doctor's Dilemma"

The narrative then moves to a seemingly ill-bred laborer, who is in fact a wealthy gentleman in disguise. He wishes, in part, to avoid his overly-affectionate wife, but also to preach socialism, of which he is a staunch convert. The story is then largely subsumed in a discussion of socialism and briefly concludes with the suitable marriages of the now-grown schoolgirls. Getting Married is a play by George Bernard Shaw. First performed in 1908, it features a cast of family members who gather together for a marriage. The play analyses and satirises the status of marriage in Shaw's day, with a particular focus on the necessity of liberalising divorce laws."

It was published in Shaw's 1901 collection Three Plays for Puritans.

Marriage, as the knot in question, is exemplified by the union of Marian Lind, a lady of the upper class, to Edward Conolly, always a workman but now a magnate, thanks to his invention of an electric motor that makes steam engines obsolete. The marriage soon deteriorates, primarily because Marian fails to rise above the preconceptions and limitations of her social class and is, therefore, unable to share her husband's interests. The Man of Destiny is an 1897 play by George Bernard Shaw, set in Italy during the early career of Napoleon.

Zeno a disagreeable nephew of the Cardinal Archbishop. He is sent to investigate the truth of the miracle in a small place called Four Mile Water. Zeno tends to dislike other people who do not appreciate his intelligence and the way he lives his life. He ruffles a few feathers with his behavior. Though remembered primarily as a playwright and novelist, Irish writer George Bernard Shaw was an insatiably curious intellect whose interests encompassed a broad array of topics. This exegesis on Wagner's Ring cycle relates the opera series to ideas like capitalism and mythological archetypes."

It was written in 1893 but the strict British Censorship laws at the time meant that it was not produced on stage until 1902. This hilarious comedy of errors is sure to please fans of Shakespeare's comedies who are looking for a quick and rewarding read. The action centers around the quirky and whimsical Clandon family, four women who have lived abroad for years. The sassy Clandon daughters don't know who their father is and frankly aren't too bothered by that fact. Hilarity ensues when their biological dad stumbles into their lives through sheer happenstance."

They are assembled chronologically and are provided with annotation of elusive topical references, through the meticulous but judicious editing of Dan H. Laurence and Daniel J. Leary. The prodigious range of subjects - children's rights, creative evolution, capital punishment, blood sport, the nature of sainthood, the Irish question - remains as topical as this morning's newspaper columns. Shaw's concerns about human possibilities, and the greed, insularity and blindness that obstruct those possibilities, are as applicable today as they were a century ago. To H. M. Tomlinson, Shaw possessed a 'passionate morality that happens to be gifted with the complete control of expression'. His energetic prose is ardent, rhythmic, brimming with vitality and bursting with humour. Moreover, Shaw's voice defies time, linked as it is to a tradition extending back to the English translators of the Bible, through Dryden and Swift, to Dickens, while managing to be outrageously idiosyncratic and couched in a diction that uniquely anticipates the evolution of the language itself."

Conolly. The collection of 183 letters, all but two of which are previously unpublished, sheds new light on a partnership that for Shaw was the most important of his later playwriting career, and for Jackson was central to his pioneering and acclaimed work in British regional theatre in both Birmingham and Stratford-upon-Avon.<br /><br />Also included are letters from Shaw's wife, Charlotte, and secretary, Blanche Patch, to Jackson. Headnotes with each letter set its context and provide a narrative of the continuing Shaw-Jackson relationship; further notations identify literary, historical, theatrical, and political references and allusions. Of interest to both the Shaw specialist and the drama generalist, this collection of letters represents a significant addition to modern understanding of Shaw and of British theatre."

The many thousands of books in our collection have been sourced from libraries and private collections around the world.The titles that Trieste Publishing has chosen to be part of the collection have been scanned to simulate the original. Our readers see the books the same way that their first readers did decades or a hundred or more years ago. Books from that period are often spoiled by imperfections that did not exist in the original. Imperfections could be in the form of blurred text, photographs, or missing pages. It is highly unlikely that this would occur with one of our books. Our extensive quality control ensures that the readers of Trieste Publishing's books will be delighted with their purchase. Our staff has thoroughly reviewed every page of all the books in the collection, repairing, or if necessary, rejecting titles that are not of the highest quality. This process ensures that the reader of one of Trieste Publishing's titles receives a volume that faithfully reproduces the original, and to the maximum degree possible, gives them the experience of owning the original work.We pride ourselves on not only creating a pathway to an extensive reservoir of books of the finest quality, but also providing value to every one of our readers. Generally, Trieste books are purchased singly - on demand, however they may also be purchased in bulk.

Set in America’s Wild West and aptly subtitled ‘A Sermon in Crude Melodrama’, this single-act play concerns the conversion of a horse thief desperate to ‘keep the devil’ in him and die game. Published in 1909, it brought Shaw into conflict with the Lord Chamberlain of England, who banned it on the grounds of alleged blasphemy, and it was twelve years before the play was performed in a London theatre. In an interview Shaw commented, ‘I am sorry that Fanny’s First Play has destroyed the cherished legend that I am an unpopular playwright … for the first time I have allowed a play of mine to run itself to death … And the worst of it is it will not die.’ First performed in 1911, the play is a delightful farce in which Shaw debates some of his favourite subjects: middle-class morality, marriage, parents and children and women’s rights. And, deliberately concealing his authorship, Shaw took the opportunity to satirize contemporary drama critics who, he claimed, ‘do not know dramatic chalk from dramatic cheese when it is no longer labelled for them.’"

The many thousands of books in our collection have been sourced from libraries and private collections around the world.The titles that Trieste Publishing has chosen to be part of the collection have been scanned to simulate the original. Our readers see the books the same way that their first readers did decades or a hundred or more years ago. Books from that period are often spoiled by imperfections that did not exist in the original. Imperfections could be in the form of blurred text, photographs, or missing pages. It is highly unlikely that this would occur with one of our books. Our extensive quality control ensures that the readers of Trieste Publishing's books will be delighted with their purchase. Our staff has thoroughly reviewed every page of all the books in the collection, repairing, or if necessary, rejecting titles that are not of the highest quality. This process ensures that the reader of one of Trieste Publishing's titles receives a volume that faithfully reproduces the original, and to the maximum degree possible, gives them the experience of owning the original work.We pride ourselves on not only creating a pathway to an extensive reservoir of books of the finest quality, but also providing value to every one of our readers.

She is not a prepossessing woman. No woman looks her best after sitting up all night; and Mrs. Dudgeon's face, even at its best, is grimly trenched by the channels into which the barren forms and observances of a dead Puritanism can pen a bitter temper and a fierce pride. She is an elderly matron who has worked hard and got nothing by it except dominion and detestation in her sordid home, and an unquestioned reputation for piety and respectability among her neighbors, to whom drink and debauchery are still so much more tempting than religion and rectitude, that they conceive goodness simply as self-denial. This conception is easily extended to others - denial, and finally generalized as covering anything disagreeable. So Mrs. Dudgeon, being exceedingly disagreeable, is held to be excee-dingly good. Short of flat felony, she enjoys complete license except for amiable weaknesses of any sort, and is consequently, without knowing it, the most licentious woman in the parish on the strength of never having broken the seventh commandment or missed a Sunday at the Presbyterian church."

Pygmalion is a play by George Bernard Shaw, named after a Greek mythological character. Professor of phonetics Henry Higgins makes a bet that he can train a bedraggled Cockney flower girl, Eliza Doolittle, to pass for a duchess at an ambassador's garden party by teaching her to assume a veneer of gentility, the most important element of which, he believes, is impeccable speech. The play is a sharp lampoon of the rigid British class system of the day and a commentary on women's independence. Arms and the Man is a satirical comedy about people's idealism towards love and war."

The contract was signed on 13 December 1935 and Pascal, a charming, flamboyant Hungarian emigre with relatively little experience in cinema, did the playwright proud. Shaw's gamble paid off in this Pygmalion, which, to this day, is usually claimed to be the best film version of any of his plays.<br /><br />This first collection of the correspondence of Bernard Shaw and Gabriel Pascal contains 268 letters, the greatest portion of which have not been previously published. They provide an intimate, behind-the-scenes view of the film industry's day-to-day workings and of the art of movie-making, from the signing of the first contract between Shaw and Pascal, to Shaw's death in 1950.<br /><br />The letters reveal the great extent to which Pascal, unlike his predecessors, scrupulously kept Shaw informed of what he did. We learn about whom Pascal negotiated with, the merits of association with certain individuals or businesses, contract problems, the backbiting and backstabbing of the industry, difficulties with casting, and progress throughout the filming. Shaw accepted and embellished some of Pascal's ideas for production, and vehemently disagreed with others. Their correspondence highlights the differences in personality between the two men. Shaw was ever the astute businessman, while Pascal was the eager artist. Shaw the methodical mastermind contrasted sharply with Pascal the entrepreneur with many projects under development, few of which came to fruition.<br /><br />Most important, however, the letters, postal cards, and telegrams collected here reveal how Pascal fought for the integrity of Shavian cinema; how, as a director, he tried to create films that were true to their dramatic sources; and how, in partnership with Pascal, Shaw's cinematic writings flourished."

Between 1885 and 1888, Bernard Shaw published 111 book reviews in the Pall Mall Gazette. In spite of their importance as the first regular journalism Shaw wrote and the fact that the books (fiction, nonfiction, plays, and poetry) he read during these years must have formed the nucleus of his permanent library, the reviews have never before been analyzed in connection with Shaw's work. Brian Tyson has assembled the book reviews, complete with the books' titles, authors, and a brief biography of each author, including any comments Shaw made about the review, and has placed them in historical context, elucidating any interesting, difficult, or obscure references.<br /><br />Tyson's critical introduction places the reviews in the context of Shaw's work and Victorian society. The reviews are often characterized by the wit and brilliance that we associate with the later Shaw, shedding light on his development as a writer at his most formative stage.<br /><br />Regardless of the merits of the material Shaw was reviewing, it is amusing and enlightening to follow him down to the wandering tributaries of Late Victorian fiction and poetry, which reveal as much about Shaw as they do about the preoccupations and prejudices of the average reader of the day."

Yet it is beginning to look as if Barabbas was a failure, in spite of his strong right hand, his victories, his empires, his millions of money, and his moralities and churches and political constitutions. ""This man"" has not been a failure yet; for nobody has ever been sane enough to try his way. But he has had one quaint triumph. Barabbas has stolen his name and taken his cross as a standard. There is a sort of compliment in that. There is even a sort of loyalty in it, like that of the brigand who breaks every law and yet claims to be a patriotic subject of the king who makes them. We have always had a curious feeling that though we crucified Christ on a stick, he somehow managed to get hold of the right end of it, and that if we were better men we might try his plan."

I have never admitted the right of an elderly author to alter the work of a young author, even when the young author happens to be his former self. In the case of a work which is a mere exhibition of skill in conventional art, there may be some excuse for the delusion that the longer the artist works on it the nearer he will bring it to perfection. Yet even the victims of this delusion must see that there is an age limit to the process, and that though a man of forty-five may improve the workmanship of a man of thirty-five, it does not follow that a man of fifty-five can do the same, When we come to creative art, to the living word of a man delivering a message to his own time, it is clear that any attempt to alter this later on is simply fraud and forgery. As I read the old Quintessence of Ibsenism I may find things that I see now at a different angle, or correlate with so many things then unnoted by me that they take on a different aspect. But though this may be a reason for writing another book, it is no a reason for altering an existing one. What I have written I have written, said Pilate, thinking (rightly, as it turned out) that his blunder might prove truer than its revision by the elders; and what he said after a lapse of twenty-one seconds I may very well say after a lapse of twenty-one years. However, I should not hesitate to criticize my earlier work if I thought it likely to do any mischief that criticism can avert...--Bernard Shaw"

An outspoken critic of the melodramas and formulaic farces that comprised most of the popular theater in the late nineteenth century, Shaw relentlessly campaigned for audiences, actors, theater managers, and even government officials to take theater more seriously, to use the stage as a forum for representing complex real issues-such as poverty, gender relations, and political power-so that audiences could better understand and address them when they left. Shaw's commitment to social reform through theater was matched by his expertise in the artistic and practical aspects of drama: whether he was reviewing productions, lecturing about acting, or schooling agents on royalties and copyright law, Shaw set a standard for intelligent professionalism that our own theaters might still aspire to and be measured against. <br /> <i>The Critical Shaw</i> series brings together, in five volumes and from a wide range of sources, selections from Bernard Shaw's voluminous writings on topics that exercised him for the whole of his professional career: Literature, Music, Politics, Religion, and Theater.

In speeches, essays, and prefaces, Shaw relentlessly scrutinized and critiqued scores of religions, finding most of their doctrines in need of exhaustive reform.

Always with an axe to grind-whether aesthetic, ethical, or otherwise-Shaw tested the boundaries of satire in his essays, occasionally locking horns with some of the most prominent authors of his lifetime. Displaying wit and wisdom in equal proportions, his reviews remain fresh even though the authors and books they appraised have long since fallen into oblivion. <br /> <i>The Critical Shaw</i> series brings together, in five volumes and from a wide range of sources, selections from Bernard Shaw's voluminous writings on topics that exercised him for the whole of his professional career: Literature, Music, Politics, Religion, and Theater. Each volume is edited by a leading Shaw scholar; the series editor is L.W. Conolly, former president of the International Shaw Society."

Take, first, the differ ence between the trained actor and the man in the street - the layman. When the layman walks, his only object is to get to Charing Cross; when he makes a gesture, it is to attract the attention of a cab-driver or bus-conductor; when he speaks, it is to convey or demand information, or tell a lie, or otherwise further his prosaic ends; when he moves his hands, it is to put up his umbrella or to take out his handkerchief. On the stage these merely utilitarian pur poses are only simulated: the real pur pose is to produce an effect on the senses and imagination of the spectator. The actor's walk is addressed to the spectator's sense of grace, dignity, or strength of movement, and his voice to the listener's sense of expressive or beautiful tone. Impersonations even ofugly or deformed creatures with harsh voices have the same artistic character, and are agreeably disagreeable, just as the most extreme discords in a sym phony or opera are distinctly musical, and perfectly different to the random cacophonies which arise from the tun ing of the orchestra. Now, the power of complying with artistic conditions without being so preoccupied by them as to be incapable of thinking of any thing else is hard to acquire, and can be perfected only by long practice. Talma estimated the apprenticeship at twenty years. The hab1t can never be come as instinctive as keeping one's bal ance, for instance, because failure in that for even an instant means a fall, so that the practice in it is lifelong and constant; whereas the artistic habit lapses more or less in the absence of an audience, and even on the stage can be forgotten for long periods without any worse consequences than a loss of charm which nothing may bring to theactor's attention. The real safeguard against such lapses is a sense of beauty - the artistic sense - cultivated to such \a degree of sensitiveness that a coarse or prosaic tone, or an awkward gesture, jars instantly on the artist as a note out of tune jars on the musician. The defect of the old-fashioned systems of training for the stage was that they attempted to prescribe the conclusions of this constantly evolving artistic sense instead of cultivating it and leaving the artist to its guidance. Thus they taught you an old-fashioned stage-walk, an old fashioned stage-voice, an old-fashioned stage way of kneeling, of sitting down, of shaking hands, of picking up a hand kerchief, and so on, each of them sup posed to be the final and perfect way of doing it. The end of that was, of course, to discredit training altogether. But neglect of training very quickly dis credits itself; and it will now perhaps be admitted that the awakening and culture of the artistic conscience is a real.<br /><br />About the Publisher<br /><br />Forgotten Books publishes hundreds of thousands of rare and classic books.

The southwest face was the front, and was pierced by a Moorish arch fitted with glass doors, which could be secured on occasion by gates of fantastically hammered iron. The arch was enshrined by a Palladian portico, which rose to the roof, and was surmounted by an open pediment, in the cleft of which stood a black-marble figure of an Egyptian, erect, and gazing steadfastly at the midday sun. On the ground beneath was an Italian terrace with two great stone elephants at the ends of the balustrade. The windows on the upper story were, like the entrance, Moorish; but the principal ones below were square bays, mullioned. The castle was considered grand by the illiterate; but architects and readers of books on architecture condemned it as a nondescript mixture of styles in the worst possible taste. It stood on an eminence surrounded by hilly woodland, thirty acres of which were enclosed as Wiltstoken Park. Half a mile south was the little town of Wiltstoken, accessible by rail from London in about two hours.Most of the inhabitants of Wiltstoken were Conservatives. They stood in awe of the castle; and some of them would at any time have cut half a dozen of their oldest friends to obtain an invitation to dinner, or oven a bow in public, from Miss Lydia Carew, its orphan mistress. This Miss Carew was a remarkable person. She had inherited the castle and park from her aunt, who had considered her niece's large fortune in railways and mines incomplete without land. So many other legacies had Lydia received from kinsfolk who hated poor relations, that she was now, in her twenty-fifth year, the independent possessor of an annual income equal to the year's earnings of five hundred workmen, and under no external compulsion to do anything in return for it. In addition to the advantage of being a single woman in unusually easy circumstances, she enjoyed a reputation for vast learning and exquisite culture. It was said in Wiltstoken that she knew forty-eight living languages and all dead ones; could play on every known musical instrument; was an accomplished painter, and had written poetry. All this might as well have been true as far as the Wiltstokeners were concerned, since she knew more than they. She had spent her life travelling with her father, a man of active mind and bad digestion, with a taste for sociology, science in general, and the fine arts. On these subjects he had written books, by which he had earned a considerable reputation as a critic and philosopher. They were the outcome of much reading, observation of men and cities, sight-seeing, and theatre-going, of which his daughter had done her share, and indeed, as she grew more competent and he weaker and older, more than her share. He had had to combine health-hunting with pleasure-seeking; and, being very irritable and fastidious, had schooled her in self-control and endurance by harder lessons than those which had made her acquainted with the works of Greek and German philosophers long before she understood the English into which she translated them."

They shared broadly similar interests, but their lifestyles differed sharply - as did their views on many subjects, including those discussed in their correspondence: religion, socialism, science, war and world history, the theatre, the profession of authorship, and more. The letters are always forthright, often abusive and quarrelsome, sometimes suggesting that the relationship cannot last. They are also often warm, good-natured, playful, and generous - reflecting a fundamental mutual respect and similarity of outlook, however contrasting the temperament and style. The great majority of the two writers' correspondence is published here for the first time.<br /><br />This volumes comprises the personal correspondence of Shaw and Wells through the course of their friendship of more than forty years, and includes and introductory essay by J. Percy Smith. The letters are fully annotated, and are accompanied by information about the circumstances under which each was written, to enable the reader to follow the course of the frequently tempestuous relationship."

His career began modestly initially working for some years in an Estate office but a thirst for reading and knowledge moved his career to writing several novels, none of which were published for several years. He wrote as a critic for several years, mainly on the theatre where his campaigning helped moved Victorian theatre towards a more realistic form. Shaw also took up his fervent socialist views at this point, a cause he would be indelibly linked with throughout his long and productive life. An initial foray into writing a play in 1885 only came to fruition in 1892 and with it his path as one of the leading playwrights of the 20th century was set. Shaw was also a fervent Fabian and a co-founder of the London School of Economics. Saint Joan in 1923 gained Shaw yet another international success. This led in 1925 to his being awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature for his contributions to literature. The citation praised his work as .."". marked by both idealism and humanity, its stimulating satire often being infused with a singular poetic beauty."" In 1938 he added an Academy Award for his work on Pygmalion. Shaw remains the only person ever to win a Nobel Prize and an Oscar. He refused all other awards, even a knighthood. George Bernard Shaw died on November 2nd, 1950 at the age of 94, of renal failure precipitated by injuries incurred by a fall whilst pruning a tree."

He was also an essayist, novelist and short story writer. Nearly all his writings address prevailing social problems, but have a vein of comedy which makes their stark themes more palatable. Issues which engaged Shaw's attention included education, marriage, religion, government, health care, and class privilege."

In 1936, towards the end of her life, she published this supplementary two-volume work, which includes further writings and sympathetic commentary, revealing 'the development of a mind which was singularly of one piece, however many-sided'. Volume 1 addresses William Morris' artistic and literary achievements. It contains May's introductory remarks and chapters of analysis, nearly fifty miscellaneous pieces by Morris on arts and crafts, items of verse juvenilia, several poems of the Earthly Paradise period, two translations from Icelandic, and several letters."

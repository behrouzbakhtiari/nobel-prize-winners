Taken away to sober up in jail, all that night he is gripped by hallucinations: the impoverished hermit believes he has become a healer, walking from village to village, tending to the sick, waiting for a sign from God. In this dream, his one companion, Moustique, wants to exploit his power. Moustique decides to impersonate a prophet himself, ignoring a coffin-maker who warns him he will die and enraging the people of the island. Hobain, half-awake in his desolate jail cell, terrorized by the specter of his friend's corruption, clings to his visionary quest. He will try to transform himself; to heal Moustique, his jailer, and his jail-mates; and to be a leader for his people. <i>Dream on Monkey Mountain</i> was awarded the 1971 Obie Award for a Distinguished Foreign Play when it was first presented in New York, and Edith Oliver, writing in <i>The New Yorker</i>, called it a masterpiece.<br /><br /><br /><br />Three of Derek's Walcott's most popular short plays are also included in this volume: <i>Ti-Jean and His Brothers</i>;<i> Malcochon, or The Six in the Rain</i>; and <i>The Sea at Dauphin</i>.

Their principal themes are the stasis, both stultifying and provocative, of midsummer in the tropics; the pull of the sea, family, and friendship on one whose circumstances lead to separation; the relationship of poetry to painting; and the place of a poet between two cultures. Walcott records, with his distinctive linguistic blend of soaring imagery and plainly stated facts, the experience of a mid-life period--in reality and in memory or the imagination. As Louis Simpson wrote on the publication of Wacott's <i>The Fortunate Traveller, </i>""Walcott is a spellbinder. Of how many poets can it be said that their poems are compelling--not a mere stringing together of images and ideas but language that delights in itself, rhythms that seem spontaneous, scenes that are vividly there?...The poet who can write like this is a master."" <br />"

Indeed, from Valery, Yeats, Lawrence, Rilke, Akhmatova, and Auden writing in the first half of the century to such contemporary poets as Lucille Clifton, Derek Walcott, Rita Dove, Wislawa Szymborska, and Mark Strand, the material of Greek myth has elicited a poetry of remarkably high achievement. And by organizing the poems first into broad categories such as ""Heroes,"" ""Lovers,"" ""Trespassers,"" and secondly around particular mythological figures such as Persephone, Orpheus, or Narcissus, readers are treated to a fascinating spectrum of poems on the same subject. For example, the section on Odysseus includes poems by Cavafy, W. S. Merwin, Gregory Corso, Gabriel Zaid, Louise Gluck, Wallace Stevens, and many others. Thus we are allowed to see the familiar Greek hero refracted through the eyes, and sharply varying stylistic approaches, of a wide range of poets from around the world. <br /> Here, then, is a collection of extraordinary poems that testifies to--and amply rewards--our ongoing fascination with classical myth.<br />"

Della quale si può dire, innanzitutto, che ci offre la forma più alta, oggi, della lingua inglese – forse anche perché proviene da quei luoghi dove «il sole, stanco dell’impero, tramonta», da una immensa periferia marina, i Caraibi, dove quel sole, tramontando, «porta all’incandescenza un crogiolo di razze e di culture» (Brodskij). «Io sono soltanto un negro rosso che ama il mare» dice un altro verso, ma (leggiamo altrove) uno i cui «occhi ardevano per la prosa cinerea di John Donne». Già questa congiunzione di elementi, questa somma di tribù divise nelle stesse vene, e insieme la stupefacente felicità verbale, la capacità di nominare le cose come in un remoto e scintillante «canto dei marinai» rendono unico Walcott e rimandano alla più sobria e precisa descrizione che a lui ha dedicato il suo critico, ma anche poeta, più congeniale, Iosif Brodskij: «Walcott non è un tradizionalista né un “modernista”. A lui non si adatta nessuno degli “ismi” disponibili e degli “isti” che ne conseguono. Non appartiene a nessuna “scuola”: non ce ne sono molte nei Caraibi, se si eccettuano quelle dei pesci. Si sarebbe tentati di chiamarlo un realista metafisico, ma il realismo è metafisico per definizione, così come vale l’inverso. E poi, è un’etichetta che saprebbe troppo di prosa. Walcott può essere naturalista, espressionista, surrealista, imagista, ermetico, confessionale – a scelta. Semplicemente, egli ha assorbito, al modo in cui le balene assorbono il plancton o un pennello assorbe la tavolozza, tutti gli idiomi stilistici che il Nord poteva offrire: adesso cammina con le sue gambe, e a grandi passi»."

These forms have not only continued to entertain us; they ritualize rebellion, speak out against oppression, and affirm the personhood of the downpressed. This rebellion is not evident with the same intensity as it used to be. Independence and political partisanship and the growing distance of the middle class from the folk, among other developments, have seen a fluctuation in the ideals of rebellion. Yet what is incontestable is that these arts have established and maintained a safe space for conflict to be resolved or at least expressed, not in a vacuum but in the face of a status quo utilizing its muscle and myths to maintain a narrative that upholds its interests.</i><br /><br />As the situation becomes more complex and information more crucial, our literature is best placed to challenge or to consolidate these myths. Individually, we are left to decide on whose behalf our writing will be employed. In this situation, the struggle has been within the arts themselves—whether they see themselves as an extension of rebellion or art as entertainment. Although late on the scene and without the widespread appeal of the native and folk arts, our literature can lay claim to being part of these arts of rebellion, upholding and making visible the dismissed and ignored, lifting the marginalized into personhood, persuading us that a new world is required, and establishing this island as a place in which it can be imagined and created."

Soon, Gauguin, frustrated by van Gogh's refusal to acknowledge his increasingly troubled mind, will depart for Paris. In two years, van Gogh will be dead by his own hand. In the meantime, the friends discuss their craft; they frequent a local café that van Gogh will soon immortalize; they become acquainted with a young prostitute, Lotte, who becomes Gauguin's lover; they argue; they paint.<br /> In Derek Walcott's new historical play, <i>O Starry Starry Night</i>, two world-renowned artists come to life as they wrestle both with grand themes—friendship, loyalty, fame—and with more mundane concerns, money primary among them. The scenes Walcott sketches summon several of van Gogh's most famous paintings: <i>Sunflowers</i>, <i>The Night Café</i>, <i>The Bedroom at Arles</i>. His manipulation of language—van Gogh's eloquent monologues giving way to more abstract speeches—evokes the painter's descent into madness. Over the action hangs the threat of violence, of death, which lends the play a potent urgency; for at least one of the characters, time is quickly running out.<br /><i>O Starry Starry Night</i> is powerfully wrought, and demonstrates once again the sharpness of Walcott's eye: as a painter, as a poet, as a writer, and, above all, as an observer of human follies, foibles, failings, and aspirations."

In <i>Ghost Dance</i>, first performed in 1989, Walcott turns a story with a foregone conclusion -- Sitting Bull and his Sioux followers will die at the hands of the Army and Indian agents -- into a portrait of life at a crossroads of American history. <br /><br />In <i>Walker</i>, an opera first performed in 1992 and revised for its revival in 2001, Walcott shifts his attention east, taking for his subject David Walker, the nineteenth-century black abolitionist. In Walcott 's hands Walker becomes a classical hero for his people: a leader who is also a poet.<br /></div><br />"

Un arcipelago al quale, da allora, non hanno mai smesso di aggiungersi nuove isole, ma le cui coordinate sono rimaste immutate: dalle promesse giovanili di <i>In una notte verde</i> – imparare «a soffrire in giambici accurati», «lodare finché amore duri, i vivi e i morti bruni» – alle riflessioni sull’arte e sulla vecchiaia del <i>Prodigo</i>. Una dedizione totale alla poesia e una preoccupazione per la condizione umana nate dalla volontà di rimanere fedele a un’epifania precoce – magistralmente narrata nel poema autobiografico <i>Un’altra vita</i> – che, alla maniera di Dante, ha segnato e continua a segnare il corso di un’intera esistenza. Ripercorrere l’avventura letteraria di Walcott significa assistere al dispiegarsi di un dono poetico capace, come forse nessun altro ai nostri giorni, di coniugare il lampo lirico dell’istante «in cui ogni sfaccettatura» è «còlta in un cristallo di ambiguità» con il gesto aperto e impersonale dell’epica. Il risultato, sulla pagina, è un’opera di straordinaria versatilità formale, magnificenza linguistica e precisione metaforica, costantemente illuminata da una compassione ampia, come nei grandi poeti di ogni tempo."

Η γλώσσα του είναι τοπική, αλλά η οπτική του είναι παγκόσμια κι αυτό το ποιητικό εύρος του επιτρέπει να συνδυάζει και συγχρόνως να συμπτύσσει την αγάπη του για την Καραϊβική με φαινομενικά άσχετα μεταξύ τους γεγονότα, όπως η φρίκη του Ολοκαυτώματος ή η γοητεία που ασκούσε επάνω του ο «ασημένιος αιώνας» της ρωσικής ποίησης ή η Ελλάδα του Ομήρου.

Δεν δείλιασε ποτέ μπροστά στις ξεκάθαρες έννοιες και τόλμησε ν' αγγίξει μεγάλα θέματα στην ποίησή του.<br />When Derek Walcott was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1992 the Swedish Academy referred to his «poetic oeuvre of great luminosity, sustained by a historical vision, the outcome of a multicultural achievement.»<br />His language is local, yet his vision is universal and this poetic breadth permits him to simultaneously combine and compress his love for the Caribbean with seemingly unrelated events such as the Holocaust or his fascination with the «silver age» of Russian poetry and Homeric Greece. Walcott haw never been afraid of this height. He has not shied from broad gestures and the daring required of addressing large subjects in his work."

""Three Rainbows"" began as three 60-foot long rainbow paintings--probably the largest watercolors ever made. For Clemente, whose attraction to given forms (such as the mandala) has long formed an integral part of his iconography, the rainbow suggests a number of important interpretations: it is a bridge (and therefore a structure that brings things together), a phenomenon that occurs after a period of darkness (Clemente's works of recent years had darkened noticeably) and a reversible image capable of leading the eye in opposite directions. The artist's affinity for watercolor derives in part from the medium's immediacy--an ideal vehicle for Allen Ginsberg's ""first thought, best thought""--and these works betray his spontaneity and joy in making them."

Paul Simon, one of America's foremost singer-songwriters and winner of twelve Grammy Awards over three decades, has joined with the Nobel Prize-winning poet Derek Walcott to weave an enticing musical tale unlike anything that has come before it.<p>Based on a true tale that begins in New York's Spanish Harlem in the 1950s, The Capeman tells the story of Salvador Agron, a young Puerto Rican known as the Capeman because of the cape he wears as a member of a street gang, the Vampires. Sal is convicted of murdering two young boys on a playground and is sentenced to die in the electric chair at the age of sixteen. His odyssey through the criminal-justice system, his escape from prison, and his subsequent travails are the template on which Paul Simon and Derek Walcott have created an unique theatrical experience rich in lyricism, passion, and suspense. The book is illustrated with Walcott's drawings.</p>"

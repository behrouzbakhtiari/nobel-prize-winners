The first, <i>From War to War,</i> consists of Churchill's critical observations on the settlement of World War I and its place in the causes of the Second World War. The second volume contains letters and memoranda from the British government--of which Churchill was part--as the country plunged unprepared into war.

Here, too, he re-creates the dawn of modern warfare: the buzz of airplanes overhead, trench combat, artillery thunder, and the threat of chemical warfare.

Victorious in the Battles of Blenheim (1704), Ramillies (1706), and countless other campaigns, Marlborough, whose political intrigues were almost as legendary as his military skill, never fought a battle he didn't win. Although he helped James II crush the rebellion of the Duke of Monmouth, Marlborough later supported William of Orange against James II in the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and brilliantly managed England's diplomatic triumphs during the War of the Spanish Succession. Marlborough also bequeathed the world another great British military strategist and diplomat—his descendant, Winston S. Churchill, who wrote this book to redeem Marlborough's reputation from Macaulay's smears.<br /><br />One million words long and ten years in the making, Churchill's <i>Marlborough</i> stands as both a literary and historical masterpiece, giving us unique insights into the Churchill of World War II, for just as Churchill's literary skill helps us understand the complexities of Marlborough's life, so too did his writing of Marlborough help Churchill master the arts of military strategy and diplomacy.

Some cheer-leaders of war can always get out a pamphlet telling the best way to go through that small but necessary business at the end. PM may have published it already in a special Sunday issue with pictures. They might even have it bound up as a companion piece to the issue I read in November 1941 entitled “How We Can Lick Japan in Sixty Days.” No. This book will not tell you how to die. This book will tell you, though, how all men from the earliest times we know have fought and died. So when you have read it you will know that there are no worse things to be gone through than men have been through before. When you read the account of Saint Louis the IX’s Crusade you will see that no expeditionary force can ever have to go through anything as bad as those men endured. We have only to fight as well as the men who stayed and fought at Shiloh. It is not necessary that we should fight better. There can be no such thing as better. And no thing that can ever happen to you from the air can ever be worse than the shelling men lived through on the Western Front in 1916 and 1917. The worst generals it would be possible to develop by a process of reverse selection of brains carried on over a period of a thousand years could never make a worse mess than Passchendaele and Gallipoli. Yet we won that war and we must win this one. The editor of this anthology, who took part and was wounded in the last war to end war, hates war and hates all the politicians whose mismanagement, gullibility, cupidity, selfishness and ambition brought on this present war and made it inevitable. But once we have a war there is only one thing to do. It must be won. For defeat brings worse things than any that can ever happen in a war. Regardless of how this war was brought on, step by step, in the Democracies’ betrayal of the only countries that fought or were ready to' fight to prevent it, there is only one thing now to do. We must win it. We must win it at all costs and as soon as possible. We must win it never forgetting what we are fighting for, in order that while we are fighting Fascism we do not slip into the ideas and ideals of Fascism. <br /><br />For many years you heard American people speak who admired Mussolini because he made the trains run on time in Italy. It never seemed to occur to them that we made the trains run on time in America without Fascism. Germany profited by the lessons of the last war. Her army leaders discarded the whole conception of war in which they and the allies had been bogged down for four years until Ludendorff’s break through against the British Fifth Army in March of 1918. Now the Germans have been making the trains run on time in this war. They have been new sorts of trains and they have handled them with the hard, cold professional brilliance of the new German army which learned the lessons of the last war and used Spain and Poland as its proving grounds. <br /><br />But all the things that they have been learning and proving they have been learning and proving for us too. We are not in the position of the French who refused to learn anything ever because of their illusion that they had won the last war when, in fact, they were completely morally defeated by the Spring of 1917 and never re- covered from it. The truth about the mutinies in the French Army after the failure of the Chemin Des Dames offensive in the early spring of 1917 has never been fully told. I spent much time with French military observers in Spain where the Germans were trying out weapons, planes and tactics."

Victorious in the Battles of Blenheim (1704), Ramillies (1706), and countless other campaigns, Marlborough, whose political intrigues were almost as legendary as his military skill, never fought a battle he didn't win. Although he helped James II crush the rebellion of the Duke of Monmouth, Marlborough later supported William of Orange against James II in the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and brilliantly managed England's diplomatic triumphs during the War of the Spanish Succession. Marlborough also bequeathed the world another great British military strategist and diplomat—his descendant, Winston S. Churchill, who wrote this book to redeem Marlborough's reputation from Macaulay's smears.<br /><br />One million words long and ten years in the making, Churchill's <i>Marlborough</i> stands as both a literary and historical masterpiece, giving us unique insights into the Churchill of World War II, for just as Churchill's literary skill helps us understand the complexities of Marlborough's life, so too did his writing of Marlborough help Churchill master the arts of military strategy and diplomacy. This two-volume edition includes the entire text and almost all the original maps."

He wasted no time getting hired as a war correspondent for The Morning Post, and sailed from Southampton aboard the Dunottar Castle on October 14, reaching Cape Town by October 31st.<br /><br />For the next eight months he filed regular despatches to The Morning Post.

In their own words, Winston and Clementine recount some of the most momentous events of the twentieth century: the sinking of the Titanic, the abdication of King Edward VIII, the downfall of governments, the Depression, and two world wars. Here are harrowing first-hand accounts from the battlefields of 1915, reflections on political triumphs and upsets, as well as domestic minutiae, foreign travel, revelations of social scandals and, above all, words of mutual support and encouragement that span the career of one of Britain's most revered statesmen. Speaking for Themselves is not only an important historical document, it is a love story and an intimate, charming and often surprising insight into one of the century's most successful marriages.<br /><br />Mary Soames is perfectly placed to select and comment upon this vast collection of letters. And in her introduction and notes she complements the letters with explanatory notes, biographical details and her own personal recollections."

In between, he touches on subjects as diverse as spies, cartoons, submarines, elections, flying, and the future. Reading these essays—originally dictated late at night in the 1920s in his study, and by which he was able to support his family and live like a lord without inherited wealth—is like being invited to dinner at Churchill’s country seat at Chartwell, where the soup was limpid, Pol Roger Champagne flowed, the pudding had a theme, and Churchill entertained lucky visitors with vivid conversation. This ISI Books edition, with a new introduction and notes by James W. Muller, Academic Chairman of the Churchill Centre, recovers Churchill’s unforgettable table talk for a new generation of readers."

Despite his successes, Marlborough’s later years were full of struggle—including attacks from political and personal enemies.<br /><br /><br />Winston Churchill vividly recounts the intrigues and challenges of his ancestor’s highly eventful life. In this last volume, detailing the end of his career, Marlborough’s story is told with sensitivity and nuance—giving the reader an intimate glimpse into his state of mind. It’s a fascinating read for anyone interested in English history—and provides profound insights into leadership, loyalty, and personal conduct as valuable today as three centuries ago."

Veremos a Jack London haciendo surf y a un elegante matrimonio, en un cuento de Scott Fitgerald, a punto de zozobrar, real y figuradamente, en el curso de una larga travesía. Asistiremos con Turguénev a un incendio en el mar y con Kafka a la confesión de un hombre condenado a vagar en una barca por toda la eternidad… La nómina de autores aquí representados reúne varios nombres clave de la literatura universal.<br /><br />Autores recogidos en esta antología: Hernando Colón, Alexandre O.

No segundo volume, Churchill relata com minúcia os eventos marcantes ocorridos desde dezembro de 1941 até 1945, como o ataque a Pearl Harbor e a construção das alianças decisivas entre Inglaterra, URSS e os Estados Unidos, além de construir um epílogo assustadoramente lúcido sobre os possíveis desdobramentos do maior conflito bélico de todos os tempos."

Churchill'],['4.28'],[],[],[],"A disturbingly prophetic account of the events leading up to World War II, this anthology is a collection of Churchill’s reporting for the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> and the <i>Evening Standard</i> from 1936 to 1939—tracing Hitler’s rise to power, the Nazi invasion of the Rhineland, and other events leading up to the declaration of war. <br /> <br />In the first few years of Nazi ascendance, many European intellectuals and leaders advocated avoiding war and negotiating with Hitler. Churchill is one of the few who understood the scope of the Nazi threat and advocated armament against Germany early on—and his early prescience serves as a fine prediction of his determined stance against Hitler as a World War II leader and statesman. <br /> <br /> ABOUT THE AUTHOR  <br />Sir Winston Churchill was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1953 “<i>for his mastery of historical and biographical description as well as for brilliant oratory in defending exalted human values</i>.” <br /> <br />Over a 64-year span, Churchill published over 40 books, many multi-volume definitive accounts of historical events to which he was a witness and participant. All are beautifully written and as accessible and relevant today as when first published. <br /> <br />During his fifty-year political career, Churchill served twice as Prime Minister in addition to other prominent positions—including President of the Board of Trade, First Lord of the Admiralty, Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Home Secretary. In the 1930s, Churchill was one of the first to recognize the danger of the rising Nazi power in Germany and to campaign for rearmament in Britain. His leadership and inspired broadcasts and speeches during World War II helped strengthen British resistance to Adolf Hitler—and played an important part in the Allies’ eventual triumph. <br /> <br />One of the most inspiring wartime leaders of modern history, Churchill was also an orator, a historian, a journalist, and an artist. All of these aspects of Churchill are fully represented in this collection of his works. <br /> <br /> ABOUT THE SERIES  <br />When the Conservative government was defeated in Britain’s 1929 general election, Winston Churchill was exiled from the party—chiefly because of his disagreements with party leaders over Indian Home Rule and protective tariffs, as well as his connections with financiers, press barons, and others who were not trusted by Conservative leadership. <br />"

Over the course of forty books and countless speeches, broadcasts, news items and more, he addressed a country at war and at peace, thrilling with victory but uneasy with its shifting role on the global stage. In 1953, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature for “his mastery of historical and biographical description as well as for brilliant oratory in defending exalted human values.” During his lifetime, he enthralled readers and brought crowds roaring to their feet; in the years since his death, his skilled writing has inspired generations of eager history buffs.<br />  <br /> Best known for his political genius and keen eye for military tactics, Churchill was a man of many talents—not the least of which was painting. Throughout his life, Churchill painted to relieve his mind from the demands of leadership and to keep the “black dog” of depression at bay.<br />  <br /> Included in this volume are Churchill’s meditations on painting as a salve for the spirit and an essential creative pursuit. His love for the craft comes to life in this concise yet impassioned work. This volume includes eighteen reprints of Churchill’s original work in oil, giving the reader a window into the little-known creative and artistic skill of this prominent figure in twentieth century history.</div>"

Le succès est immédiat : la Première Guerre mondiale est encore dans tous les esprits – elle n’est achevée que depuis cinq ans – et ces Mémoires traitent d’une période pendant laquelle Churchill était ministre. Premier lord de l’Amirauté, il se trouve alors au cœur des affaires internationales, au plus près des leaders politiques et militaires du temps. Et ses écrits livrent donc un aperçu sans précédent des coulisses du conflit. <br /><br />Pendant près de cinq ans, il œuvre aux préparatifs de la guerre, rencontre les différents responsables, tente d’imposer ses vues, est confronté aux différentes crises gouvernementales, attaqué à la fois par les conservateurs et les membres de son parti. Jamais inactif, il se rend en octobre 1914 à Anvers où l’armée belge est encerclée. Favorable à l’opération dans les Dardanelles, Churchill passe pour l’initiateur du projet ; son échec lui est alors imputé et il démissionne en novembre 1915. S’ensuit alors une douloureuse traversée du désert. <br /><br />Churchill se fait le chroniqueur des événements qui ont bouleversé l’Europe entre 1911 et 1915, et dont il a été le témoin autant que l’acteur. <br /><br />Un document irremplaçable sur l’histoire de la Première Guerre mondiale."

Distilling the ideas and language of a series of brilliant speeches, Churchill created in The People's Rights a powerful plea for 'a great policy of social reconstruction and reorganization'.<br /><br />In the years before 1914, Churchill's energy an enthusiasm for radical schemes of social and constitutional reform were unquenchable. Political enemies and jealous colleagues sometimes dismissed his work as nothing more than the product of ambitious opportunism. But, opportunist and man of ambition though he was, he was nevertheless inspired by a profound concern for the welfare of the working population. Churchill supported and initiated Liberal reforms because he believed in them. None of his contemporaries in the Liberal cabinet delved more deeply into the underlying causes of contemporary political and social problems. Few could match his powers of argument and exposition in defence of Liberal principles on the platform.<br /><br />After sixty years, his unequivocal denunciations of the House of Lords ('a lingering relic of the feudal order'), 'the unnatural gap between rich and poor', 'the divorce of the people from the land', 'the swift increase of vulgar, joyless luxury', continue to command assent. 'Churchill', an eminent critic recently pronounced, 'had no vision of the future'. The People's Rights, forged in the furnace of controversy, eloquently contradicts this judgment. Three generations after its first appearance, its phrases can still move, its aspirations still challenge an imperfect society.<br /><br />Cameron Hazlehurst, a Research Fellow of Nuffield College, Oxford, contributes a short introduction on Churchill's early political ideas and the historical background to The People's Rights."

Churchill, begun by his son, Randolph Churchill, and completed by Martin Gilbert following Randolph’s death in 1968, was based on documents from the Churchill papers and from more than one thousand other archives, both public and private. Among the many archival jewels are Churchill’s most private and personal letters from his early childhood to his old age, uncensored family correspondence, the letters and diaries of his closest friends and fiercest opponents, secret diplomatic telegrams, and the daily exchanges of an active politician, a prolific writer, a vivid journalist, an historian, a painter, and a man of action.<br /><br />Churchill’s personal papers are among the most comprehensive ever assembled relating to the life and times of one man. They are so extensive that it is only possible to include in the narrative volumes a part of the relevant documents. The volumes titled <i>The Churchill Documents </i>were planned to run parallel with the narrative volumes, and with them to form a whole.<br /><br />Here in the first two volumes of <i>The Churchill Documents—</i>Volume 1: <i>Youth, 1874-1896</i> and Volume 2: <i>Young Soldier, 1896-1901</i>—are set out all the documents relevant to the first volume of the biography, <i>Winston S. Churchill: Youth, 1874-1900</i>. When an extract or quotation appears in the narrative volume, the complete document appears here. Where space prevented the inclusion of a contemporary letter in the narrative volume, it is included here.<br /><br />The young Winston Churchill led a varied and dramatic life in his first twenty-two years. From his childhood disputes with his parents and at school, and his struggles as an officer cadet to master the art of military life, to his first visit to New York and his remarkable impressions of that city, to his dangerous journey through war-torn Cuba as an eyewitness to the Spanish Army’s attempt to crush the Cuban insurgents, he set down his thoughts in letters that are vivid, well-argued, witty, and full of passion. The intensity of his feelings, the breadth of his opinions, and his tenacity of purpose shine through in these early years, as he gathered the will and determination to confront the world."

This is a selection of the best Churchill quotations about Britain gleaned from books, articles, speeches, private papers and conversations, compiled with the assistance or scholars, family members and those who knew him. His belief in the strength, courage and moral fibre of the British was always reflected in the poetic cadence of his rousing words.<br /><br />'Never give in, never, never, never, never-in nothing, great or small, large or petty-never give in except to convictions of honour and good sense.'<br /><br />'We shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender'<br /><br />'Today we may say aloud before an awe-struck world, ""We are still masters of our fate. We are still captains of our souls.'<br /><br />'In a long and varied life I have constantly watched and tried to measure the moods and inspirations of the British people.

He was then brought into government as Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies.<br /><br />During this period he also wrote a two-volume biography of his father.

It includes Churchill’s letters to his mother, letters that range over every aspect of his public and private life.<br /><br />Included as well are letters from his American friend Bourke Cockran, from Frank Harris, who acted as his literary agent, and from Lord Hugh Cecil, his closest friend at the time, with whom he sought to break the mould of politics.<br /><br />The correspondence in this volume shows a young man in a hurry, but with strong convictions and clear abilities, on determined to make his mark on the national stage."

First, their countries seek no aggrandizement, territorial or other; Second, they desire to see no territorial changes that do not accord with the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned; Third, they respect the right of all peoples to choose the form of gov- ernment under which they will live; and they wish to see sovereign rights and self government restored to those who have been forcibly deprived of them; Fourth, they will endeavor, with due respect for their existing obli- gations, to further the enjoyment by all States, great or small, victor or vanquished, of access, on equal terms, to the trade and to the raw mater- ials of the world which are needed for their economic prosperity; Fifth, they desire to bring about the fullest collaboration between all nations in the economic field with the object of securing, for all, impro- ved labor standards, economic advancement and social security; Sixth, after the final destruction of the Nazi tyranny, they hope to see established a peace which will afford to all nations the means of dwel- ling in safety within their own boundaries, and which will afford assurance that all the men in all lands may live out their lives in freedom from fear and want; Seventh, such a peace should enable all men to traverse the high seas and oceans without hindrance; Eighth, they believe that all of the nations of the world, for real- istic as well as spiritual reasons must come to the abandonment of the use of force. Since no future peace can be maintained if land, sea or air arm- aments continue to be employed by nations which threaten, or may threaten, aggression outside of their frontiers, they believe, pending the establish- ment of a wider and permanent system of general security, that the disarma- ment of such nations is essential. They will likewise aid and encourage all other practicable measure which will lighten for peace-loving peoples the crushing burden of armaments. Franklin D. Roosevelt Winston S.

Unfortunately, his concerns at the time were almost entirely disregarded by Britain's leaders, who sought to avoid confrontation and war at almost any cost."

This fascinating book gives us an infallible insight from one shrewd politician about the times, circumstances and the most significant events which led to the outbreak of World War 1. Although the book nominally stars in 1911 when Churchill became head of the Admiralty, the narrative commences in 1870 with the Franco-Prussian War and ends with Turkey and the Balkans. Churchill comments on German ""threats of war"" over recognition by Serbia of the Austrian annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1908, which led to talks between the British and French General Staffs over concerted action in the event of war."

Le haut commandement français a espéré être capable de refermer la brèche, surtout que les armées du Nord étaient sous ses ordres. De plus, une retraite de ce type aurait presque certainement impliqué la destruction de l’excellente armée belge, de plus de 20 divisions, ainsi que l’abandon de toute la Belgique. Ainsi, quand le commandement a réalisé la force et la portée de la percée allemande et que le général Weygand a pris les commandes à la place du général Gamelin, un effort a été fait par les armées françaises et britanniques en Belgique pour continuer de tenir la main droite des Belges et de donner leur propre main droite à une armée française nouvellement créée qui aurait avancé en grande force à travers la Somme pour la saisir."

Churchill’s vivid personality is evident as each controversy unfolds—traced through private letters and secret Cabinet records. Martin Gilbert’s explanatory notes, never obtrusive, illuminate both the individuals and the events of twenty-one dramatic months.Covering every aspect of Churchill’s life when he was successively Minister of Munitions and Secretary of State for War, Martin Gilbert has also drawn material from the Churchill Papers, now at Churchill College, Cambridge, and from many other archival sources, both private and public.For Churchill, the period was dominated by the early problems of peace, the continued intervention in Russia against the Bolsheviks, the Russo-Polish war, terrorism, and the search for conciliation in Ireland, revolt in Iraq, Britain’s Palestine Mandate, and the future of Britain’s position in the Middle East. His wife Clementine is an ever-present influence."

They contain the documentary evidence of his initiatives, setbacks, and achievements as wartime First Lord of the Admiralty. The volume includes his efforts to sustain the siege of Antwerp, his support for the use of air power in war, and his central part in the early development of the tank. It also shows the enthusiasm and forcefulness with which he supported an offensive naval policy, first against Germany, then against Turkey, impressing and influencing his colleagues.<br /><br />By examining in detail the evolution of British war policy, Martin Gilbert has discovered the extent to which the precise nature of Churchill’s involvement and responsibility, with regard to all he controversial aspects of his war policies, differed greatly from what many of his contemporaries believed: misconceptions that soon became widely accepted in the public mind.<br /><br />A few of the documents reproduced here were first printed in full in Volume III of the eight-volume Churchill biography. Others were printed in part, but most only as brief extracts or not at all. In this volume, the materials selected are reproduced in full. A substantial number are published here for the first time.<br /><br />More than half the documents printed here come from the Churchill papers now at Churchill College, Cambridge. The remainder were found in more than seventy different archival sources, both public and private. The selection is not restricted to Churchill’s own writings; the context in which he was putting forward his opinions, and the part played by colleagues and opponents in influencing policy, are illustrated throughout by other people’s letters, diaries, and documents, most published here for the first time."

Churchill comments on German ""threats of war"" over recognition by Serbia of the Austrian annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1908, which led to talks between the British and French General Staffs over concerted action in the event of war."

Yet the desire to be more than just 'Randolph's boy', allied to a relentless urge to be in the thick of things, meant that it was a political career to be forged far from dingy town halls and the elegant cocktail parties of the rich and powerful. Thus, with little writing or military experience to his name, the young Churchill set off to Cuba to make his mark. In this campaign and those that followed in India, the Sudan and South Africa, he developed the spare and deliberately controversial style that was to make him both a household name and a journalist respected and feared in parliamentary circles. His stinging attacks on the Indian Government, the Cabinet and the commanders he served under ended any chance of a military career--but it was public attention and not a prestigious staff appointment that he sought. While Churchill relished the hazards of the front line, the excitement of battle was tempered by a sombre realisation of the futility of war. In the same way, his passionate belief in Queen and Empire did not prevent him from admiring a worthy enemy, and his reports are remarkable for their objectivity at a time when jingoistic propaganda was the norm. Frederick Woods has assembled a set of despatches that rank among the best writings of this master of the English language. Complemented by an excellent introduction and informative notes throughout, they are at once an enthralling read and an open window into the world of an embattled empire."

The original American editions from 1933 split the first two British volumes into four volumes, making the entire first American set six volumes.<br /><br />John Churchill, the Duke of Marlborough (1650-1722), was one of the greatest military commanders and statesmen in the history of England. Victorious in the Battles of Blenheim (1704), Ramillies (1706), and countless other campaigns, Marlborough, whose political intrigues were almost as legendary as his military skill, never fought a battle he didn't win. Although he helped James II crush the rebellion of the Duke of Monmouth, Marlborough later supported William of Orange against James II in the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and brilliantly managed England's diplomatic triumphs during the War of the Spanish Succession. Marlborough also bequeathed the world another great British military strategist and diplomat—his descendant, Winston S. Churchill, who wrote this book to redeem Marlborough's reputation from Macaulay's smears.<br /><br />One million words long and ten years in the making, Churchill's Marlborough stands as both a literary and historical masterpiece, giving us unique insights into the Churchill of World War II, for just as Churchill's literary skill helps us understand the complexities of Marlborough's life, so too did his writing of Marlborough help Churchill master the arts of military strategy and diplomacy."

H. Asquith, the blood of the dead of the Gallipoli was repeatedly laid to his charge.<br /><br />A few of the documents reproduced here were first printed in full in Volume III of the eight-volume Churchill biography. Others were printed in part, but most only as brief extracts or not at all. In this volume, the materials selected are reproduced in full. A substantial number are published here for the first time.<br /><br />More than half the documents printed here come from the Churchill papers now at Churchill College, Cambridge. The remainder come from more than seventy different archival sources, both public and private. The selection is not restricted to Churchill’s own writings; the context in which he was putting forward his opinions, and the part played by colleagues and opponents in influencing policy, are illustrated throughout by other people’s letters, diaries, and documents, most published here for the first time."

The original American editions from 1933 split the first two British volumes into four volumes, making the entire first American set six volumes.<br /><br />John Churchill, the Duke of Marlborough (1650-1722), was one of the greatest military commanders and statesmen in the history of England. Victorious in the Battles of Blenheim (1704), Ramillies (1706), and countless other campaigns, Marlborough, whose political intrigues were almost as legendary as his military skill, never fought a battle he didn't win. Although he helped James II crush the rebellion of the Duke of Monmouth, Marlborough later supported William of Orange against James II in the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and brilliantly managed England's diplomatic triumphs during the War of the Spanish Succession. Marlborough also bequeathed the world another great British military strategist and diplomat—his descendant, Winston S. Churchill, who wrote this book to redeem Marlborough's reputation from Macaulay's smears.<br /><br />One million words long and ten years in the making, Churchill's Marlborough stands as both a literary and historical masterpiece, giving us unique insights into the Churchill of World War II, for just as Churchill's literary skill helps us understand the complexities of Marlborough's life, so too did his writing of Marlborough help Churchill master the arts of military strategy and diplomacy."

He would place Churchill's articles on current world events in major newspapers across Europe--and for significantly more money than Churchill's present agent. ""I am absolutely convinced,"" Emery Reves assured Churchill, ""that you will find the diffusion of your articles satisfactory.""So began a profitable business relationship that grew into an enduring personal friendship. In this book, Martin Gilbert chronicles that relationship through the correspondence of Winston Churchill and Emery Reves. He preserves a compelling record of how each man used the other's talents to forward a cause that passionately engaged them both--the spread of democratic ideals in a post-totalitarian world.<br /><br />The correspondence ranges from short notes to lengthy letters and reveals the important role that Reves played in Churchill's writing life. Before World War II, Reves worked untiringly to place Churchill's pro-democracy articles in newspapers around the world. After the war, he acted as agent and editor for Churchill's war memoirs and his four-volume History of the English-Speaking Peoples and ultimately made Churchill one of the highest-paid authors of nonfiction in the twentieth century. The Churchill-Reves correspondence will be essential reading for all students and scholars of the Churchill era."

Churchill']","['3.50', '4.28']",[],[],[],"Captain Francis Arthur Dickinson (1874-1915) was an officer in the British army and a first rate big game hunter. Due to Dickinson's notoriety as a great big game hunter he was selected by Winston Churchill to escort him on big game hunts while Churchill was Under Secretary of State for the African Colonies. <br /> <br />According to Churchill: ""I KNOW by experience that Captain Dickinson in person is an ideal companion and guide through the countries which he describes; and I feel sure that those who are less fortunate than myself will find his book an excellent substitute for his presence. They will realize from his manner of writing his constant cheerfulness, his stores of resource for every difficulty and emergency, and his full knowledge and understanding of every problem which can confront the traveller or the sportsman. Elephants are to him like partridges, and hippopotami like hares; and he has an eye which can identify the rarest of the antelopes by the twinkle of its tail behind a thorn-thicket at a hundred yards. All his advice on the details of big-game shooting is based on long experience interpreted by sound instinct and acute intelligence; and the only drawback to his teaching is that it will not allow his disciples the satisfaction of improving on it. <br /> <br />""Under a literary style which is all his own, Captain Dickinson has a message to convey. It is the interest and spirit of a genuine sportsman, who knows how to find the game, how to kill, and —much rarer quality—how to spare. <br />He is fortunate in the countries in which his service has lain. These great wild lands offer to the young officer not only opportunities of sport or adventure, but a contact with responsibilities and realities which is a special education in itself. Few return to the prosaic routine of peace-time soldiering in England without new qualities of knowledge and character, to compensate them for the regrets with which they look back, and often, alas, for the health they leave behind them. Reading these pages brings vividly back to me mellow and charming recollections of British East Africa and Uganda, two years ago—the stir in camp before daybreak, breakfast under the stars, the long tramp through the dripping elephant grass while the sun rose higher and higher and the thermometer bounded up in company, the oases of rest in the ""bandas"" with food and drink assuming totally new values, the cool of the evening, and the long sittings round the camp fire ; and the thrill of the stealthy prowling through reed and thicket in the rhinoceros and elephant country, when at each moment the next step might disclose the hide of some unconscious but formidable enemy. <br />These paths are rapidly growing less solitary. The steamers multiply, the railways extend. Important footsteps brush back the jungle. The hunter who from some secret spot watches the slow procession of the elephants, or surprises the rhinoceros grazing placidly, is surveying a threatened if not a vanishing civilisation. We approach the period of more game-laws and less game. The achievements which this book records will become increasingly rare as the years pass by, and Captain Dickinson's jaunty chronicle will one day be studied by a generation of sportsmen who will view the ""good old times"" with envious and ultimately unbelieving eyes."" <br /> <br /> <br />This book originally published by J. Lane in 1910 has been reformatted for the Kindle and may contain an occasional defect from the original publication or from the reformatting. <br />"

Churchill In his first book, the renowned statesman and historian chronicles an 1897 British military campaign on the Northwest Frontier, in the vicinity of modern Pakistan and Afghanistan. Churchill served as a correspondent and cavalry officer in the conflict, and his incisive reportage reflects the energy and vision that re-emerged in his leadership during World War II. At the time of the clash, Churchill was serving as a subaltern in the 4th Hussars. Weary of regimental life, the young soldier drew upon family connections to find a place among the brigades headed for the frontier. There he participated in his first combat in the Mamund Valley, where British troops suppressed a revolt among the region's Pathan tribes. Churchill's series of letters to the London Daily Telegraph formed the basis for this book, which he declared ""the most noteworthy act of my life,"" reflecting ""the chances of my possible success in the world."" A century later, the towering historical figure's account of military action in this still-volatile region remains powerfully relevant. We are delighted to publish this classic book as part of our extensive Classic Library collection. Many of the books in our collection have been out of print for decades, and therefore have not been accessible to the general public. The aim of our publishing program is to facilitate rapid access to this vast reservoir of literature, and our view is that this is a significant literary work, which deserves to be brought back into print after many decades. The contents of the vast majority of titles in the Classic Library have been scanned from the original works. To ensure a high quality product, each title has been meticulously hand curated by our staff. Our philosophy has been guided by a desire to provide the reader with a book that is as close as possible to ownership of the original work.

During this time, John Brodrick, the Secretary of State for War, proposed an expansion of Britain's peacetime military--a plan which Churchill strongly opposed. <br /> <br />Churchill attacked Brodrick's plan in six fiery speeches on the subject--speeches that generated strong support and left Brodrick politically isolated. Mr. Brodrick's Army is a compilation of all six of these speeches. With fewer than 20 first editions currently in existence, it is the rarest of Churchill's works--remarkable not only for its historical significance, but for its early display of the oratorical brilliance for which Churchill would become known."

Churchill was a master not only of the battlefield, but of the page and the podium. Over the course of forty books and countless speeches, broadcasts, news items and more, he addressed a country at war and at peace, thrilling with victory but uneasy with its shifting role in global politics. In 1953, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature for ""his mastery of historical and biographical description as well as for brilliant oratory in defending exalted human values."" During his lifetime, he enthralled readers and brought crowds roaring to their feet; in the years since his death, his skilled writing has inspired generations of eager history buffs.<br /><br />This collection of 1920s-30s magazine and newspaper articles convey the extraordinary variety and depth of Churchill's thoughts on the questions, both lofty and quotidian, facing humankind. From oil painting to learning to fly an airplane, from cartoons to commanding a frontline infantry battalion in World War One, these essays bring the great man's wit and intellect to life.<br /><br />With a new introduction and notes by James W. Muller, academic chairman of the International Churchill Society, this edition recovers Churchill's unforgettable table talk for a new generation of readers."

Churchill tells the tale of the Anglo-Egyptian reconquest of the Sudan. It isn't just an account of the battles and the politics; it's the story of the destiny of the people of the region: Churchill with his powerful insight tells how the war changed the fates of England, Egypt, and the Arabian peoples in northeast Africa. In vivid style the book describes the background to the war, the relationship of the Upper Nile to Egypt, the murder of General Charles George Gordon in the siege at Khartoum, the political reaction in England, and Kitchener's elaborate preparations for the war. While in the Sudan, Churchill participated in the Battle of Omdurman. Churchill comments at length on the mechanisation of war with use of the telegraph, railroad, and a new generation of weaponry.

Churchill In his first book, the renowned statesman and historian chronicles an 1897 British military campaign on the Northwest Frontier, in the vicinity of modern Pakistan and Afghanistan. Churchill served as a correspondent and cavalry officer in the conflict, and his incisive reportage reflects the energy and vision that re-emerged in his leadership during World War II. At the time of the clash, Churchill was serving as a subaltern in the 4th Hussars. Weary of regimental life, the young soldier drew upon family connections to find a place among the brigades headed for the frontier. There he participated in his first combat in the Mamund Valley, where British troops suppressed a revolt among the region's Pathan tribes. Churchill's series of letters to the London Daily Telegraph formed the basis for this book, which he declared ""the most noteworthy act of my life,"" reflecting ""the chances of my possible success in the world."" A century later, the towering historical figure's account of military action in this still-volatile region remains powerfully relevant.

À partir du moment où les défenses françaises à Sedan et sur la Meuse ont été détruites à la fin de la deuxième semaine de mai, seule une retraite rapide à Amiens et au Sud aurait pu sauver les armées anglaise et française, qui étaient entrées en Belgique à l'appel du roi belge  ; mais ce fait stratégique n'a pas été compris sur-le-champ. Le haut commandement français a espéré être capable de refermer la brèche, surtout que les armées du Nord étaient sous ses ordres. De plus, une retraite de ce type aurait presque certainement impliqué la destruction de l'excellente armée belge, de plus de 20 divisions, ainsi que l'abandon de toute la Belgique. Ainsi, quand le commandement a réalisé la force et la portée de la percée allemande et que le général Weygand a pris les commandes à la place du général Gamelin, un effort a été fait par les armées françaises et britanniques en Belgique pour continuer de tenir la main droite des Belges et de donner leur propre main droite à une armée française nouvellement créée qui aurait avancé en grande force à travers la Somme pour la saisir. <br />Cependant, l'irruption allemande, telle une faux aiguisée, a fauché la droite et l'arrière des armées du Nord. Huit ou neuf divisions blindées, chacune d'environ 400 véhicules blindés de différents types, mais soigneusement assortis de telle sorte qu'ils soient complémentaires et divisibles en de plus petites unités indépendantes, ont coupé toute communication entre nous et la majeure partie des armées françaises. Cela a coupé nos propres voies de ravitaillement en nourriture et en munitions, en prenant d'abord Amiens, puis Abbeville, et se frayant un chemin jusqu'à la côte par Boulogne et Calais, se rendant presque à Dunkerque. Juste après cet assaut mécanisé et blindé a suivi de nombreuses divisions allemandes transportées par camions, et derrière elles encore ont cheminé, relativement lentement, la terne masse brute de l'armée ordinaire allemande ainsi que le peuple allemand, toujours prêt à piétiner d'autres terres de liberté et de confort qu’ils n'ont jamais connues."

Churchill, begun by his son, Randolph Churchill, and completed by Martin Gilbert following Randolph’s death in 1968, was based on documents from the Churchill papers and from more than one thousand other archives, both public and private. Among the many archival jewels are Churchill’s most private and personal letters from his early childhood to his old age, uncensored family correspondence, the letters and diaries of his closest friends and fiercest opponents, secret diplomatic telegrams, and the daily exchanges of an active politician, a prolific writer, a vivid journalist, an historian, a painter, and a man of action.<br /><br />Churchill’s personal papers are among the most comprehensive ever assembled relating to the life and times of one man. They are so extensive that it is only possible to include in the narrative volumes a part of the relevant documents. The volumes titled <i>The Churchill Documents </i>were planned to run parallel with the narrative volumes, and with them to form a whole.<br /><br />Here in the first two volumes of <i>The Churchill Documents—</i>Volume 1: <i>Youth, 1874-1896</i> and Volume 2: <i>Young Soldier, 1896-1901</i>—are set out all the documents relevant to the first volume of the biography, <i>Winston S. Churchill: Youth, 1874-1900</i>. When an extract or quotation appears in the narrative volume, the complete document appears here. Where space prevented the inclusion of a contemporary letter in the narrative volume, it is included here.<br /><br />The young Winston Churchill led a varied and dramatic life in his first twenty-two years. From his childhood disputes with his parents and at school, and his struggles as an officer cadet to master the art of military life, to his first visit to New York and his remarkable impressions of that city, to his dangerous journey through war-torn Cuba as an eyewitness to the Spanish Army’s attempt to crush the Cuban insurgents, he set down his thoughts in letters that are vivid, well-argued, witty, and full of passion. The intensity of his feelings, the breadth of his opinions, and his tenacity of purpose shine through in these early years, as he gathered the will and determination to confront the world."

Lord Randolph Churchill had been a much-maligned character toward the middle and end of his life, and part of the purpose of this biography was to lift the haze of scandal surrounding his name. <br /> <br />This first volume deals with early events in Lord Randolph Churchill’s life, including his upbringing, his education, and his quarrel with the Prince of Wales over a woman being courted by his brother. This episode resulted in a temporary exile from society that would serve as a prequel to Randolph’s later disgrace. While Churchill is clearly a supporter of his father’s, he is not afraid to be honest about the mistakes and failures of his career and personal life. <br /> <br />ABOUT THE AUTHOR <br />Sir Winston Churchill was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1953 “<i>for his mastery of historical and biographical description as well as for brilliant oratory in defending exalted human values</i>.” <br /> <br />Over a 64-year span, Churchill published over 40 books, many multi-volume definitive accounts of historical events to which he was a witness and participant. All are beautifully written and as accessible and relevant today as when first published. <br /> <br />During his fifty-year political career, Churchill served twice as Prime Minister in addition to other prominent positions—including President of the Board of Trade, First Lord of the Admiralty, Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Home Secretary. In the 1930s, Churchill was one of the first to recognize the danger of the rising Nazi power in Germany and to campaign for rearmament in Britain. His leadership and inspired broadcasts and speeches during World War II helped strengthen British resistance to Adolf Hitler—and played an important part in the Allies’ eventual triumph. <br /> <br />One of the most inspiring wartime leaders of modern history, Churchill was also an orator, a historian, a journalist, and an artist. All of these aspects of Churchill are fully represented in this collection of his works."

Then follows his entry into the Cabinet as President of the Board of Trade, his courtship with and marriage to Clementine Hozier, his prominent part in the successful parliamentary and public struggle to curb the powers of the House of Lords, his work for prison reform as Home Secretary, his deepening involvement in defence matters, and his opening months as First Lord of the Admiralty.<br /><br />The correspondence relating to his journey through East Africa and along the Nile shows that he combined political action and reflection with a sense of adventure. On his return, his private life took a turn toward courtship and marriage. His correspondence with “my darling Clementine” weaves an intimate and revealing thread throughout the remaining document volumes.<br /><br />From the spring of 1908, Churchill was a full and active member of the British Cabinet, and remained so for seven years. These letters disclose how seriously he took his Cabinet responsibilities, and how fertile was his administrative work. He was at the forefront in challenging and destroying the power of the House of Lords to veto social legislation involving government expenditure. It was a prolonged and bitter battle that brought him in conflict with the Court.<br /><br />The prison reform correspondence reveals a humane and compassionate Churchill. He had also, as Home Secretary, to confront and suppress the riots and disturbances that followed the industrial unrest of 1910. His refusal to allow troops to confront the miners of Tonypandy, in South Wales, was denounced by his former Conservative colleagues as too lenient.<br /><br />With the Agadir Crisis of 1911, Churchill moved to confront concern for Britain’s weakness at sea. Recognising his patriotic zeal and practical abilities, Prime Minister Asquith appointed him First Lord of the Admiralty. The last pages of this volume follow his steps into this new responsibility."

E. Morison）說：「邱吉爾不愧是一位歷史作家……以往諸大師中，包括希羅多德、修昔提底斯、吉朋等人亦不得專美於前。」<br /><br />作者簡介<br /><br />溫斯頓．邱吉爾（Winston S. Churchill，1874.11-1965.1），20世紀偉大的政治領袖。<br /><br />　　1900年當選為英國保守黨議員，以後歷任英國政府殖民副大臣、商務大臣、內政大臣、海軍大臣、不管部大臣、軍需大臣、陸軍大臣、空軍大臣、財政大臣等要職，在每一個崗位上，他都做的有聲有色，頗有建樹。1939年英國參加第二次世界大戰後，他開始擔任海軍大臣，後來在1940年5月至1945年7月間，擔任聯合政府首相；1951-1955年間又任保守黨政府首相。由於在一戰期間擔任英國海軍大臣，二戰期間又擔任英國首相，兩次帶領英國渡過最艱難灰暗的時刻，並獲得了最終的勝利。其高度的文學素養亦為舉世所公認，著作等身，包括了：《南道夫．邱吉爾傳》、《我的非洲之行》、《自由主義和社會問題》、《人民的權利》、《我的早年生活》、《印度》、《當代的偉人們》，以及描述其先祖的《馬博洛傳》（四卷）、記錄第一次世界大戰之宏篇鉅著《世界的危機》（五卷）和大英帝國的歷史著述《英語民族史》（四卷）等。

Based on one of the richest archives of modern British history, it deals both with Churchill’s personal and political life and with the political and international scene of which he was part.<br /><br />In addition to the Churchill papers, Martin Gilbert has drawn on material from more than seventy private archives, many of them not examined before. The documents, letters, and telegrams presented here are copiously annotated. The biographical footnotes enable the reader to learn, at a glance, the careers of those mentioned in the documents.<br /><br />Among the subjects covered in this volume are Churchill’s return to Conservatism in 1924, the General Strike of 1926 and the continuing coal strike that year, the story of the <i>British Gazette, </i>and Churchill’s work as Chancellor of the Exchequer, including the return to the Gold Standard, war debts, and his five budgets. There is much new material about Churchill’s life at Chartwell, his friendships, and his political and personal relationships, both with the leading figures of the day and with many of those who were then embarking on their own political careers.<br /><br />Martin Gilbert presents, in these 1,500 pages, a portrait in-the-round of Churchill himself, revealing many unexpected facets of Churchill’s character and presenting a vivid picture of five troubled and intense years of British political life."

Churchill’s vivid personality is evident as each controversy unfolds—traced through private letters and secret Cabinet records. Martin Gilbert’s explanatory notes, never obtrusive, illuminate both the individuals and the events of nineteen dramatic months.<br /><br />Covering every aspect of Churchill’s life when he was successively Secretary of State for War and Secretary of State for the Colonies, Martin Gilbert has also drawn material from the Churchill Papers, now at Churchill College, Cambridge, and from many other archival sources, both private and public.<br /><br />For Churchill, this period was dominated by the search for peace and reconciliation in Ireland, the establishment of a Jewish National Home in Palestine, the intensification of conflict with Turkey, and the political crisis that ended the peacetime coalition and Churchill’s own ministerial career. On a personal level, the death of his mother and his young daughter Marigold was a time of great sadness and reflection. Clementine Churchill was an ever-present source of comfort and advice. And the purchase of a house in the Kent countryside—Chartwell—opened up new vistas."

Although a hobby, Winston Churchill wrote of the effect that it had on him personally and professionally. At the age of 40, in 1915, painting literally pulled Churchill out of his darkest political days and set him on his journey towards his finest hour. It was painting, he said, that helped him cope with the stress and strain of his political life, and allowed him to be productive as he developed his thinking about the rising danger of Hitler and Germany. In addition, Churchill found that the skills he learned from painting made his leadership more effective and he used his painter's eye to achieve his political and diplomatic goals. The Art of Diplomacy was exhibited at the Millennium Gate Museum in Atlanta from October 3, 2014 - February 1, 2015. The catalogue includes: Foreword by Daivd Coombs, author, Sir Winston Churchill: His Life and His Paintings, About the exhibition: Did painting help save Western Civilization? By English Cook, Curator, and Duncan Sandys, Winston Churchill's great-grandson, Thirty-three paintings created by Churchill, Churchill paintings exhibition history dating to 1921, and the story of the Churchill family and Georgia."

Churchill', 'Paul Spera']","['4.28', '3.33']",[],[],[],"Sir Winston Churchill was a British statesman, orator, and author who, as prime minister, rallied the British people during World War II and led Britain to an allied victory. Churchill's ""bulldog"" spirit seemed to summarise the mood of the British people even during the bad times, such as Dunkirk, and the inspirational victories, such as the Battle of Britain. His was a brilliant mind, full of wit and intelligence; his oratory brilliance and his admirable style led him to win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1953.<br /><br />Churchill is quoted in the English language perhaps more than anybody, with the exception of Shakespeare; and as he considered them a shortcut to unending pools of knowledge, he was a great fan of quotation collections too. In that spirit, these 100 quotes have been carefully selected from his body of work to introduce you to his mighty spirit and let you draw freely from his literary finds and wits.<br /><br />Listening Length: 22 minutes<br />Author: Winston Churchill<br />Narrator: Paul Spera<br />Audible.com Release Date: April 10, 2018"

Kevesen tudják róla, hogy lelkes tollforgató volt és elnyerte az irodalmi Nobel-díjat is. Ebben a - legjobbnak tartott - könyvében élete első harminc évéről ír, ami nem volt mindig felhőtlen. Pocsék tanuló volt, az iskolában verték, fiatal katonaként izgalmas kalandokban volt része, többször majdnem megölték. Hadifogságba esett, majd megszökött, vérdíjat tűztek ki a fejére és elbukta az első parlamenti választását. Végül minden jóra fordult, de az odáig vezető út élete végéig tartó nyomokat hagyott rajta.<br /><br />Aki nem olvasta ezt a könyvet, sosem értheti meg igazán Churchillt és a 20. század legvéresebb eseményeinek a hátterét. Írása nemcsak tanulságos, de szikrázóan szellemes stílusának köszönhetően rendkívül szórakoztató is."

Au plus noir de la bataille d'Angleterre, dans un Londres harcelé par les bombardements allemands, chaque mot devait porter, frapper. Du sang, du labeur, de la sueur, des larmes. Mais le génie de Churchill, c'est beaucoup plus qu'un sens permanent de la formule. C'est une métrique incomparable, une musique et aussi cette voix, qu'on croit entendre, rocailleuse, emmêlée, essoufflée ; six ans durant, elle a incarné la résistance des Alliés contre l'Axe. Le lecteur trouvera rassemblé ici le meilleur des discours de guerre de Churchill. Indisponibles en français depuis la fin des années cinquante, ils ont été entièrement retraduits et commentés."

Churchill’s vivid personality is evident as each controversy unfolds—traced through private letters and secret Cabinet records. Martin Gilbert’s explanatory notes, never obtrusive, illuminate both the individuals and the events of two and a half dramatic years.<br /><br />Covering every aspect of Churchill’s life when he was successively Minister of Munitions and Secretary of State for War, Martin Gilbert has also drawn material from the Churchill Papers, now at Churchill College, Cambridge, and from many other archival sources, both private and public.<br /><br />For Churchill, the period was dominated first by the need to defeat Germany; then by the post-war settlement and the Allied intervention against the Bolsheviks in Russia; and by a growing personal awareness of the strong forces of disruption and chaos with which the early years of the twentieth century were being threatened. The many private letters published here show the range of Churchill’s moods and the extent of his fears. His wife Clementine is an ever-present influence."

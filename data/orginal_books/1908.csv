Purchasers can usually download a free scanned copy of the original book (without typos) from the publisher. Not indexed. Not illustrated. 1913 edition. Excerpt: ...The learned treatises of Spinoza lead, in some of their main points, to decisive contradictions. This is especially so in regard to the monism so strongly emphasised in his teaching--it is really a monism only in appearance; and Spinoza's system on closer investigation is seen to be a dualism of Naturalism and Mysticism. But in spite of all contradictions the inner freedom and breadth manifest in his works can be held in the highest honour. Thus there arises a twofold mode of viewing and valuing things: one dealing with a learned formulation and a precise wording of the teaching; the other dealing with the stimulating spirit present in all the teaching. This twofold aspect explains the remarkable fate--especially the change of valuation--by which many Systems of Thought have been overtaken. Wolff, with his systematic and precise work, was during his own lifetime held in the highest esteem, and was a distinguished member of all the great European Societies. The absence from his teaching of a stimulating spirit and of an elevated conception of life was not observed by the learned members of these Societies; but when these defects in Wolff's teaching were afterwards discovered the judgment of the members of learned Societies bordered almost on injustice to him. But Spinoza, on the other hand, was ignored not only by the orthodox but also by the learned of his day; such an impartial thinker as Bayle termed the Spinozistic Philosophy a lamentable absurdity (Gallimathias pitoyable); and yet Spinoza became for some of the greatest German poets and thinkers their fountain of fresh life. Such a welling-up life is often discovered only where it is active from the outset; and judged according to such a criterion alone it fritters away the history of..."

Franklin Delano Roosevelt's Pearl Harbor ""Day of Infamy"" speech is one of various commentaries on war, politics and the polity. Others are Bierce's moving description of a solitary Civil War hero, Woodrow Wilson speaking to capitalism's spiritual crisis, Rev. Jee Gam presenting a Chinese Christian's thoughts on the Boxer Rebellion, and a partisan, Eugene Weeks, eulogizing Calvin Coolidge. Intuitive self-direction is the theme of Lafcadio Hearn's essay ""A Mystery of Crowds."" Other selections that touch on personal development are Robert Louis Stevenson on literary style, Gelett Burgess on creativity and the art of play, Brann on the relative worth of the sexes, and Mary Wood-Allen on what a woman should know in picking a husband. For the musically inclined, Lawton Mackall has an amusing look at pianos, while sports enthusiasts will enjoy Benjamin Richardson's treatise on what to avoid in cycling. Artists should be interested in the biography of designer William Kilburn, who, in the late 1700s, was the first artist to seek copyright for his original textile designs. Summary by Sue Anderson William Tudor Jones translated ""The Failure of Speculative Philosophy."" George Ripley translated ""On the Social Element in Religion."""

(Worth every penny spent!)<br /><br /><br />***<br /><br /><br />PREFACE<br /><br /><br />SOCIALISM comprises an ideal of life as well as an economic statement. This ideal the politician may relegate to a secondary place and rarely notice, but for the philosopher it is the chief matter to be considered. Beyond both politician and philosopher, moreover, is the plain man, in whose mind the various movements of our time meet and must be adjusted to each other.<br /><br />The economic question is a child of our own time and is directly related to the present condition of the world, but philosophy is based upon the tranquil work of thousands of years. Yet even philosophy seems to have reached a critical stage where radical alterations of all human things are demanded. We see everything about us in a state of suspense, and in the strain which ensues we may hope to obtain some general improvement by combining the two points of view. It is a strange situation to see ancient wisdom join hands with the advancing present: to find permanent hopes of human nature shooting through the stormy agitation of the day.<br /><br />As a thinking being man does not exhaust his powers in the situation of the moment, the passing hour. To give point to his efforts he needs to direct his gaze to a higher order of life and a larger happiness. It is hope that gilds for him the dreariness of life, and lends it some joy and splendour. That is true, in the first place, of the individual, but it holds also for the race; for the race itself cannot prosper unless it seeks its task in life as a whole, is conscious of possibilities that are full of promise, and tries its strength upon obstacles. The higher the wave of life rises in this sense, the more zealously will new paths be sought, and the more passionately shall we try to determine which resource is the best for attaining the desired end. The question may rend humanity into hostile camps and give rise to grave doubts about the meaning of the whole scheme of things, but the doubts themselves will invest it with an incomparable greatness. The race now receives its fate from no alien power, but earns it by its own resolution and will.<br /><br />This conflict over the ideal of life is shared by Socialism. But the struggle has only in the course of time passed from being a secondary current into the great stream of life, and concentrated all attention upon itself. We shall see how many causes have contributed to this, but we know from the start how it has become a burning question, not only for the German people, but for the whole race. We cannot, however, sufficiently appreciate the situation to-day without recalling first, in general outline, the story of how the present strain developed."

Our aim is to provide readers with the highest quality reproductions of fiction and non-fiction literature that has stood the test of time. The many thousands of books in our collection have been sourced from libraries and private collections around the world.The titles that Trieste Publishing has chosen to be part of the collection have been scanned to simulate the original. Our readers see the books the same way that their first readers did decades or a hundred or more years ago. Books from that period are often spoiled by imperfections that did not exist in the original. Imperfections could be in the form of blurred text, photographs, or missing pages. It is highly unlikely that this would occur with one of our books. Our extensive quality control ensures that the readers of Trieste Publishing's books will be delighted with their purchase. Our staff has thoroughly reviewed every page of all the books in the collection, repairing, or if necessary, rejecting titles that are not of the highest quality. This process ensures that the reader of one of Trieste Publishing's titles receives a volume that faithfully reproduces the original, and to the maximum degree possible, gives them the experience of owning the original work.We pride ourselves on not only creating a pathway to an extensive reservoir of books of the finest quality, but also providing value to every one of our readers. Generally, Trieste books are purchased singly - on demand, however they may also be purchased in bulk. Readers interested in bulk purchases are invited to contact us directly to enquire about our tailored bulk rates."

Or, if it were originally a term of the schools, by what steps of transition did it proceed from one meaning to another, till finally it took on a signification which was the opposite of that which it originally bore, or till two correlated terms completely interchanged their significations? The remark of Cole ridge is often repeated, that there are cases in which more knowledge of more value may be conveyed by the history of a word than by the history of a campaign.

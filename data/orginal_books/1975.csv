His life was divided by political duties and poetry, the most of famous of which was inspired by his meeting with Bice Portinari, whom he called Beatrice,including <i>La Vita Nuova</i> and <i>The Divine Comedy</i>.

For, as Dante insists, without a trace of sentimentality or intellectual compromise, even Hell is a work of divine art.<br />Esolen also provides a critical Introduction and endnotes, plus appendices containing Dante’s most important sources—from Virgil to Saint Thomas Aquinas and other Catholic theologians—that deftly illuminate the religious universe the poet inhabited."

Eliot and first published in 1909. <br /> <br />Eliot had stated in speeches that the elements of a liberal education could be obtained by spending 15 minutes a day reading from a collection of books that could fit on a five-foot shelf. (Originally he had said a three-foot shelf.) The publisher P. F. Collier and Son saw an opportunity and challenged Eliot to make good on this statement by selecting an appropriate collection of works, and the Harvard Classics was the result. <br /> <br />Eliot worked for one year with William A. Neilson, a professor of English; Eliot determined the works to be included and Neilson selected the specific editions and wrote introductory notes. Each volume had 400–450 pages, and the included texts are ""so far as possible, entire works or complete segments of the world's written legacies."" The collection was widely advertised by Collier and Son, in Collier's and elsewhere, with great success. <br /> <br />Eight years later Eliot added a further 20 volumes as a sub-collection titled 'The Harvard Classics Shelf of Fiction', offering some of the greatest novels and short stories of world literature. The exhaustive anthology of the 'The Harvard Classics' comprises every major literary figure, philosopher, religion, folklore and historical subject up to the twentieth century."

Before he can begin to work out where he is, his path is blocked by a leopard, a lion and a she-wolf. Things get worse from here, and our pilgrim finds himself on a journey through the very depths of Hell. Why is he here, and will he ever make it out alive? During his journey, Dante meets the worst sinners imaginable and witnesses how God punishes them. Although they writhe and wail in tortured agony, he must remain strong, for he has to make it through or he may find himself lost in this dismal place forever. Who will Dante meet on his journey, and what will he learn? Real Reads are accessible texts designed to support the literacy development of primary and lower secondary age children while introducing them to the riches of our international literary heritage. Each book is a retelling of a work of great literature from one of the world’s greatest cultures, fitted into a 64-page book, making classic stories, dramas and histories available to intelligent young readers as a bridge to the full texts, to language students wanting access to other cultures, and to adult readers who are unlikely ever to read the original versions."

Es considerada la obra maestra de la literatura italiana y una de las cumbres de la literatura universal. Se considera por tanto que la redacción de la primera parte habría sido alternada con la redacción del Convivium y De Vulgari Eloquentia, mientras que De Monarchia pertenecería a la época de la segunda o tercera etapa, a la última de las cuales hay que atribuir sin duda la de dos obras de menor empeño: la Cuestión del agua y la tierra y las dos églogas escritas en respuesta a sendos poemas de Giovanni del Virgilio."

From the ballads and rime of his youth to the heart-rending lyrics written on the death of Beatrice and the more sober, philosophical canzoni of his later years, this volume provides the only English edition of the great Florentine's complete love poems, in striking verse translations by Dante specialists J. G. Nichols and Anthony Mortimer."

   Jules Verne: Seven Novels 
 <br /><b>Homer's</b> two epics of the ancient world, <i>The Iliad &amp; The Odyssey</i>, tell stories as riveting today as when they were written between the eighth and ninth century B.C. <i>The Iliad,</i>, which tells of the siege of Troy by the Greeks, is an unforgettable tale of nations at war and of the courage and compassion heroic soldiers show upon the field of battle. <i>The Odyssey</i> is the story of the Greek hero Odysseus and the many marvels and challenges he encounters during his ten-year voyage home to Ithaca after the end of the Trojan War. This edition employs Samuel Butler's classic translations of both texts.<br /><br />A landmark of world literature, <i>The Divine Comedy</i> tells of the poet <b>Dante's</b> travels through Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise in search of salvation. Before he is redeemed by his love for the heavenly Beatrice, he learns the meaning of evil, sin, damnation, and forgiveness through a series of unforgettable experiences and encounters. This edition of <i>The Divine Comedy</i> features Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's renowned and 135 full-page reproductions of Gustave Dore's classic engravings from the 1867 edition.<br /><br /><b>Jane Austen</b> revolutionized the literary romance, using it as a stage from which to address issues of gender politics and class-consciousness rarely expressed in her day. The seven novels included in this collection<i>Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, Mansfield Park, Emma, Northanger Abbey, Persuasion,</i> and <i>Lady Susan</i>represent all of Austen's mature work as a novelist, and provide the reader with an introduction to the world she and her memorable characters inhabited.<br /><br />Here, in one volume are all four full-length novels and fifty-six short stories about the colorful adventures of Sherlock Holmes. Every word <b>Sir Arthur Conan Doyle</b> ever wrote about Baker Street's most famous resident. Also included is an introduction by lifetime Sherlockians, Christopher and Barbara Roden.<br />It's a story that has enthralled readers for centuries. <i>The Arabian Nights</i> are the tales that saved the life of Shahrazad, whose husband, the king, executed each of his wives after a single night of marriage. Beginning an enchanting story each evening, Shahrazad always withheld the ending. A thousand and one nights later, her life was spared forever.<br /><br /> Many readers know Victorian England through the writings of <b>Charles Dickens</b>. Not only did Dickens put a face on the era through his memorable characters, he also captured the spirit of his age in entertaining fiction spun from its social concerns and historical events. This literary omnibus brings together five of Dickens s best-known novels: <i>Oliver Twist, A Christmas Carol, David Copperfield, Great Expectations,</i> and <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>. Prolific, energetic, and committed to social change, no other novelist of the time did so much as Charles Dickens to rally his readers to action, and no other writer at any time has created such an extraordinary collection of well-loved novels.<br /><br />The Complete Works of William Shakespeare has long been established as one of the most authoritative editions of the works of <b>William Shakespeare</b>. This updated edition includes a brief biography of Shakespeare by Germaine Greer and an introduction to his theater by Anthony Burgess; new introductions to the plays and poems written by a team from Glasgow University; an essay on the significance of the Alexander text; and a glossary with 2,500 words and phrases.<br /><br />The Chronicles of Narnia have enchanted millions of readers over the last fifty years, and the magical events described in <b>C. S. Lewis's</b> immortal prose have left many a lasting memory. For here is a world where a witch decrees eternal winter, where there are more talking animals than people, and where children can become royalty. All of the magic and wonder of The Chronicles of Narnia is brought to you in this elegant leatherbound edition. Featuring beautiful full-color illustrations and eye-catching end papers, you'll want to keep this book where everyone can see it.<br /><br />With the words Once upon a time, the <b>Brothers Grimm</b> transport readers to a timeless realm where witches, giants, princesses, kings, fairies, goblins, and wizards fall in love, try to get rich, quarrel with their neighbors, and have magical adventures of all kindsand in the process reveal essential truths about human nature. A cornerstone of Western culture since the early 1800s, <i>Grimm s Fairy Tales</i> is now beloved the world over. This collection of more than 120 of the Grimms best tales includes such classics as Cinderella, Snow White, Hansel and Gretel, Rapunzel, Rumpelstiltskin, Little Red Riding Hood, and The Frog Prince, as well as others that are no less delightful. This new edition features beautiful full-color illustrations throughout to provide even more magic to these beloved tales.<br /><br /><b>Jules Verne</b> expressed the universal fascination with adventure and exploration.

While carefully pointing out the uniqueness, tone, and color of each of Dante's thirty-four cantos, Fowlie never loses sight of the continuity of the poet's discourse. Each canto is related thematically to others, and the rich web of symbols is displayed and disentangled as the poem's unity, patterns, and structures are revealed.  What particularly distinguishes Wallace Fowlie's reading of the <i>Inferno</i> is his emphasis on both the timelessness and the timeliness of Dante's masterpiece. By underlining the archetypal elements in the poem and drawing parallels to contemporary literature, Fowlie has brought Dante and his characters much closer to modern readers. <br /><br />"

So begins Frank Salvidio's compelling translation of the great journey of Western Christian Civilization-the pilgrimage of Dante Alighieri from the exile of sin to the Promised Land of salvation-a journey whose beginning in fire and ice has made the expression ""Dante's Inferno"" a commonplace in virtually every language of the modern world. As in his translation of the Vita Nuova, praised not only for its exceptional clarity and fidelity to the original, but also for its ""thoughtfully-woven representation of the graceful straightforwardness of the linguaggio dantesco,"" Salvidio has once again recreated Dante's intense and riveting voice in the unadorned simplicity of American English. Additionally, the facing notes-succinct and scholarly-make this translation ideal for students of the poem."

Purgatorio</em> is the second volume in this set and opens with Dante the poet picturing Dante the pilgrim coming out of the pit of hell. Similar to the <em>Inferno</em> (34 cantos), this volume is divided into 33 cantos, written in tercets (groups of 3 lines). The English prose is arranged in tercets to facilitate easy correspondence to the verse form of the Italian on the facing page, enabling the reader to follow both languages line by line. In an effort to capture the peculiarities of Dante's original language, this translation strives toward the literal and sheds new light on the shape of the poem. Again the text of <em>Purgatorio</em> follows Petrocchi's <em>La Commedia secondo l'antica vulgata</em>, but the editor has departed from Petrocchi's readings in a number of cases, somewhat larger than in the previous <em>Inferno</em>, not without consideration of recent critical readings of the <em>Comedy</em> by scholars such as Lanza (1995, 1997) and Sanguineti (2001). As before, Petrocchi's punctuation has been lightened and American norms have been followed. However, without any pretensions to being ""critical"", the text presented here is electic and being not persuaded of the exclusive authority of any manuscript, the editor has felt free to adopt readings from various branches of the stemma. One major addition to this second volume is in the notes, where is found the <em>Intercantica</em> - a section for each canto that discusses its relation to the <em>Inferno</em> and which will make it easier for the reader to relate the different parts of the <em>Comedy</em> as a whole."

Essays by Teodolinda Barolini guide the reader through the new verse translations by Richard Lansing, illuminating Dante's transformation from a young courtly poet into the writer of the vast and visionary <em>Commedia</em>.<br /><br />Barolini's commentary exposes Dante's lyric poems as early articulations of many of the ideas in the <em>Commedia</em>, including the philosophy and psychology of desire and its role as motor of all human activity, the quest for vision and transcendence, the frustrating search for justice on earth, and the transgression of boundaries in society and poetry. A wide-ranging and intelligent examination of one of the most important poets in the Western tradition, this book will be of interest to scholars and poetry-lovers alike."

Essa appare nuova anche rispetto alle altre due parti del poema, già così rivoluzionarie nell'invenzione e nel linguaggio. Perché la poesia del Paradiso non racconta vicende di uomini, non descrive paesaggi. Essa si sostanzia di cose che non si vedono e che, soltanto, per fede, si sperano. E tuttavia anche e soprattutto qui il genio di Dante riesce a esprimersi con versi di grande potenza, che si imprimono per sempre nella mente del lettore con immagini di straordinaria forza suggestiva."

Hij heeft echter, voordat hij in 1302 om politieke redenen uit zijn geboortestad Florence verbannen werd, vele liefdesgedicthen geschreven die bijeengebracht zijn in de bundel Vita nuova en Rime. De eerste bundel is opgedragen aan de door hem vereerde Beatrice Portinari, die hij later als zijn leidsvrouw onsterfelijk heeft gemaakt in De goddelijke komedie. De tweede bundel bevat onder meer de gedichten die hij aan zjn andere andere geliefden wijdde. <br /><br />Voor Mijn vrouwe draagt de liefde in haar ogen vertaalde Ike Cialona eenentwintig sonnetten, een korte ballade en twee lange canzonen. Ongeveer de helft hiervan werd nooit eerder in het Nederlands vertaald. Afgedrukt naast de oorspronkelijke gedichten geven ze een mooi beeld van Dantes vroege werk en tonen ons hoe de dichter, die zich aanvankelijk voegde naar de stijl van de in zijn tijd traditionele liefdespoëzie, gaandeweg een steeds krachtiger en oorspronkelijker eigen geluid liet horen. <br /><br />Ike Cialona specialiseerde zich in het vertalen van Italiaanse poëzie. Zij vertaalde het berijmde Renaissance-epos Orlando Furioso van Ariosto en publiceerde samen met Peter Verstegen een vertaling op rijm van De goddelijke komedie."

It is one of the great poetry books of love in world literature.<br /><br />The Vita Nuova or New Life draws on (and is part of) the dolce stil novo, the sweet style of Italian poets such as Guido Cavalcanti, Guido Guinicelli, Cino da Pistoia and other stilnovisti.<br /><br />Dante was an admirer of love poetry (he praised Arnaut Daniel in the Divina Commedia). Among the influences on the Vita Nuova are, of course, the Bible (in particular the Psalms, the Song of Songs, Jeremiah s Lamentations and Christ s Passion). Other influences, apart from Classical thinkers, are Aelred of Rievaulx s De spirituali amicitia, and Peter of Blois s Deamicitia christiana. Classical and earlier writers whom Dante read included Cicero (De amicitia) and Boethius (De consolatione).<br /><br />The Vita Nouva, though, stands on its own in mediaeval literature. There is nothing else quite like it. Whereas Peter Abelard produced passionate self-exculpation and Boethius was facing death, Dante wrote a creative autobiography, a record of his love and creative life up until the year 1294.<br /><br />Dante first met Beatrice at a party given by her father Folco Portinari, the Florentine banker, on Mayday, 1274. He was nearly nine; she was nearly eight. She was wearing a red dress, and was known as Bice, a shortened form of Beatrice.<br /><br />The Vita Nuova relates the Dante-poet s experience of Beatrice in 25 sonnets, ballata, three canzoni and two incomplete canzoni consisting of one stanza and two stanzas in length. The Vita Nuova was the first book to link together poems and a prose commentary of an autobiographical and critical nature. The mixture of prose and poetry was known in mediaeval times as a prosimetrum narrative.<br /><br />Includes the Italian text and an English translation, plus an introduction and bibliography. """

Tra quelle, un posto di rilievo spetta a ""Il Fiore e il Detto d'Amore"": i due poemetti scoperti alla fine dell'Ottocento e subito attribuiti a Dante da una parte della critica. Si tratta - com'è noto - di due parafrasi, parallele e complementari, del ""Roman de la Rose"", capolavoro del Duecento francese, destinato a grande fortuna in àmbito europeo. Se l'attribuzione resta incerta, ancorché sostenuta da studiosi del valore di Guido Mazzoni, Pio Rajna, Gianfranco Contini, sicuro è il pregio letterario dei due poemetti, probabilmente opera di un unico autore, la cui presenza nel panorama culturale del Duecento italiano è degna di ogni rilievo. Edite criticamente e con ricchezza di apparati filologici ed esegetici da Contini, le due opere vengono ora riproposte in un testo attentamente riveduto e ammodernato nella resa grafica, cosí da renderne piú agevole la lettura, corredato di un ampio commento che riunisce i dati utili a una valutazione puntuale: dai riscontri col romanzo francese, per la prima volta affiancati da una traduzione italiana, ai raffronti piú significativi con l'opera di Dante e la poesia italiana del Duecento. L'edizione è preceduta da un'ampia Introduzione che ripercorre l'intricata questione attributiva."

Nel vastissimo e multiforme campo della letteratura che trae ispirazione da questo tema (e che nasce dalla profezia dell'indovino Tiresia nel canto undicesimo dell'Odissea), sono stati scelti, per questa «variazione», quelli che possono essere considerati come gli snodi fondamentali della leggenda di Ulisse: la volontà disperata di rivedere la piccola amatissima patria (Omero), il desiderio altrettanto irresistibile di abbandonarla per andare «oltre» senza scopi precisi se non quello di «lottare, cercare, trovare» (Dante, Tennyson, Dallapiccola). Nel mezzo si leva, a contrasto, la voce di un poeta come Pascoli che decostruisce il passato e il presente dell'eroe troncandone brutalmente i sogni avveniristici con la morte.<br /><br />A Leonardo Costa<br />che è tornato a Itaca"

Bringing together diverse theories of comedy from across the ages, the <i>Reader </i>reveals that, far from being peripheral, comedy speaks to the most pragmatic aspects of human life."

Before vanishing these spirits piteously implore him to speak of them to mortals on his return to earth, and leave Dante and Virgil to follow the stream to the verge of the abyss.

Er untermauert seine Ausführungen durch eine anthropologische Erörterung der menschlichen Sprachfähigkeit. Dank einer originellen Interpretation des biblischen Mythos vom Turmbau von Babel legt er eine vernünftig begründete Neubewertung der Vielfalt und der historischen Entwicklung der Sprachen vor.<br /><br />Das Problem der Sprache stellt sich im Denken Dantes in zweifacher Weise: als Problem der Sprache der Philosophie und unter dem Gesichtspunkt der Philosophie der Sprache. In ""De vulgari eloquentia"" bietet Dante ein ganzes Arsenal metaphysischer Paradigmen auf, um der sprachlichen Verständigung der Menschen eine unvordenkliche Dignität zu geben. Er stellt die gesamte Philosophie in den Dienst des Menschen als sprechendes Wesen.<br /><br />Auch wenn Dante die Doppelbestimmung der Sprache als sinnliches Zeichen, das den Gedanken des einen Menschen einem andern zu vermitteln fähig ist, von der Tradition übernimmt, setzt er andere Akzente. Die Sprache der Menschen ist nicht nur eine im Vergleich zur Transparenz der reinen Geister unvollkommenere Form der Kommunikation, sondern sie wird positiv als die dem Menschen gänzlich angemessene und entsprechende Form der Kommunikation interpretiert: Das Sprechen ist der ""herausragende Akt des menschlichen Geschlechts""."

Durling'],['4.02'],"In the early 1300s, Dante Alighieri set out to write the three volumes which make the up The Divine Comedy. Purgatorio is the second volume in this set and opens with Dante the poet picturing Dante the pilgrim coming out of the pit of hell. Similar to the Inferno (34 cantos), this volume is divided into 33 cantos, written in tercets (groups of 3 lines). The English prose is arranged in tercets to facilitate easy correspondence to the verse form of the Italian on the facing page, enabling the reader to follow both languages line by line. In an effort to capture the peculiarities of Dante's original language, this translation strives toward the literal and sheds new light on the shape of the poem. Again the text of Purgatorio follows Petrocchi's La Commedia secondo l'antica vulgata, but the editor has departed from Petrocchi's readings in a number of cases, somewhat larger than in the previous Inferno, not without consideration of recent critical readings of the Comedy by scholars such as Lanza (1995, 1997) and Sanguineti (2001). As before, Petrocchi's punctuation has been lightened and American norms have been followed. However, without any pretensions to being critical, the text presented here is electic and being not persuaded of the exclusive authority of any manuscript, the editor has felt free to adopt readings from various branches of the stemma. One major addition to this second volume is in the notes, where is found the Intercantica - a section for each canto that discusses its relation to the Inferno and which will make it easier for the reader to relate the different parts of the Comedy as a whole."

In Paradise Lost Milton tells the story of the fall of man, which encompasses a battle that rages across Heaven between God and Satan. Here are passion and innocence, victory and defeat, hope and despair. This is without a doubt the greatest epic poem ever written in the English language. Paradise Regained is often thought of as the companion to Milton's Epic Paradise Lost. Here Milton tells the full story of Christ's forty days' temptation in the desert with Satan. The detail and emotional impact are stunning. A book for the ages. The Divine Comedy is a first person narration of Dante's travels through Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven; but at a deeper level it represents allegorically the soul's journey towards God. At this deeper level, Dante draws on medieval Christian theology and philosophy. A powerful work of art that has stood the test of time. This is the brilliant Henry Wadsworth Longfellow translation that placed Dante in his proper place in the English speaking world."

Dante geeft hierin een schets van de ontwikkeling van de natuurlijke talen uit één oerbron, het Hebreeuws dat in het Paradijs werd gesproken. Origineel is ook Dante's kritische behandeling van de verschillende Italiaanse dialecten uit zijn tijd. Hij verdedigt bovendien de autonomie van het Italiaans tegenover het Provençaals dat tot dan toe de Italiaanse literatuur sterk had beïnvloed. Hij kent de 'illustere' volkstaal ook een belangrijke politieke functie toe, die van beschavingsmiddel in het door burgeroorlogen geteisterde Italië. Eenheid van taal immers zou helpen een einde te maken aan de heersende bestuurlijk-politieke anarchie.<br /><br />Dante zingt de lof van de 'illustere' volkstaal. Deze noemt hij 'edeler' dan het Latijn omdat ze als eerste, natuurlijke taal wordt aangeleerd en gesproken. Met dit originele pleidooi voor het gebruik van de eigen taal voor literaire compositie zet Dante een belangrijke stap in de emancipatie van de volkstalen ten opzichte van het 'kunstmatige' Latijn. En tegelijk geeft Dante aan de hand van talloze voorbeelden voor het eerst een poetica voor het schrijven van Italiaanse literatuur, in het bijzonder van de canzone, het type gedicht waarin hij zelf uitblinkt.<br /><br />Pleidooi voor de eigen taal vormt een interessante getuigenis van de ontwikkeling van Dante als dichter en als criticus van zijn eigen werk. In een uitvoerig nawoord, waarin ook Dante's fameuze brief aan zijn patroon Can Grande della Scala is opgenomen, bespreekt vertaler Lodi Nauta Dante's eigen commentaar op zijn Divina Commedia."

It plants itself firmly in the modern world and away from the political crimes that dominated Dante's work. It brings a very basic questioning of the man's faith as he witnesses some of the most horrendous punishments that could be exacted. The story covers the travels of the man who is sent to hell to examine the various torments and punishments that the sinners of Earth are forced to face each moment of eternity. From the slovenly gluttons to the fates of the suicides, from the heretics to the thieves, a variety of different levels are covered. From the ferry of Charon, the man is taken into the very depths of evil. He must escape the giant creature, Minos to the swallowing jaws of Cerebus. From the Dance of the Harlots who abused love to the gluttons who are encased in solid gold. Witnessing the Heretics, imprisoned in furnace like cells to the Industrialists, those who are taken over by the very machines they created. Those who kill in the name of God are forced into an unending battle of mutilation which leads to the River of Blood with the souls of Idi Amin, Hitler, and Stalin washing the crimson onto the shores. The Maze of Eternity blends into a surreal world of mystic images and fallen idols until he finally reaches the very source of evil itself, the Devil. But its not the traditional view, because after all, Lucifer was considered the Morning Star...the beautiful angel. All is not as it might first appear. .."".a most distinguished and thought-provoking piece of work."" - Chicago's New Age Magazine. Published by Caliber Comics."

Sie wird ergänzt durch: Zahlreiche knappe Erläuterungen und Lesehilfen, eine Einführung in die Göttliche Komödie und in Dantes Zeit, eine Biographie des Dichters, eine Übersicht über seine sonstigen Werke und ein ausführliches Register.<br /><br />Dantes Göttliche Komödie ist ein Höhepunkt der Weltliteratur. Obwohl im Mittelalter geschrieben, ist sie immer noch lebendige Lektüre. Doch ist es keine Komödie.<br /><br />Es ist die Schilderung einer ungewöhnlichen Reise, die der Pilger Dante antreten muss. Ihren Anfang nimmt sie bei einer „midlife crisis“, wo „der rechte Weg“ verlorengeht. Die Reise führt ihn hinab in die Hölle, dann hinauf auf den Läuterungs-berg und schliesslich ins Paradies. Ganz am Schluss wird ihm ein Blick auf das Licht Gottes zuteil. Aber er muss wieder zur Erde zurück. Es ist der Weg eines Menschen zu immer grösserer Selbsterkenntnis. (Man kann die Göttliche Komödie durch-aus auch psychologisch lesen.)<br /><br />Spirituelle Einsichten und konkrete, überraschende Geschehnisse mischen sich. In zahlreichen Begegnungen mit namhaften Persönlichkeiten im Jenseits erfahren wir von diesseitigen Schicksalen. Ein reiches Panorama des weltlichen Geschehens entfaltet sich. Es zeigen sich Höhen und Tiefen der Gesellschaft, der Politik, aber auch des familiären Lebens. Neben Vorbildlichem ist da auch Betrug, Verrat, Gewalt, Habgier und Machtstreben. In Dantes unnachahmlicher Sprache werden selbst schwierigere Themen fasslich und Abstraktes anschaulich.<br /><br />Im Italienischen ist die Göttliche Komödie in Versen mit kunstvollen Reimen gehalten. Sie im Deutschen zu imitieren, wirkt gezwungen und unbefriedigend. Diese Übersetzung strebt eine natürliche Sprache an, mit der Möglichkeit, die Zeilen als Verse zu lesen."

The Romish doctrine concerning purgatory may be combated as an article of faith, but must be admitted as a true statement of the condition of mankind, religiously considered. The wretched state of man living without God in the world; the self - conviction of sin; the necessity of a Saviour; and the possibility of attaining, through the heavy passages of contrition and the wearisome stages of penance, to the peace which passeth understanding, is the sum of the doctrines embodied in the Divina Commedia.<br /><br />About the Publisher<br /><br />Forgotten Books publishes hundreds of thousands of rare and classic books.

E siamo stati solleciti non solo della comodit� del Volume, ma anche della bont� della lezion sua; imperciocch�, quanto alla commedia DI dante, abbiamo esemplato il testo impresso in Padova nel is22, emendandolo per� in quei luoghi dove � stato poscia da Valentuomini mostrato esserne difet tosa o la lettera o l'ortografia. Il testo poi e la disposizione delle r1me del petrarca si � quello di Antonio Marsand, ma la punteggiatura e quella fattane dal Leopardi la. Quale (com' egli dice nella Prefazione al suo Petrarca novellamente impresso da questa tipografia nel Volume de' quat tro poeti 1838 - 40) io medesimo colla maggiore diligenza che mi fu pos sibile volli fare del tutto nuova. Opera tediosa a fare ma che pu� essere quasi un altro comento, perch� infiniti sono i luoghi del Petrarca e degli altri Antichi, che punteggiati scarsamente o soverchiamente o male, ap pena si possono intendere, e punteggiati avvedutamente e con misura di ventano chiarissimi. La qual sua opinione � irrefragabile, e la sua di ligenza � sperimentata per molto utile. Gli Argomenti a ciascuna Poesia sono pur quelli delma7 sand e il numero arabo che v' � saprapposto a lato del numero romano, vale per indicare la corrispondenza che in questa parte la edizion presente ha con le antiche; e cosi � del titolo che talora si legge diverso in alcune di queste Poesie medesime. I secondo de' due Indici � fatto a comodit� di chi voglia prontamente trovare nella stampa nostra le cita zioni fatte secondo le antiche. La stampa che ha servito di esempio alla edizione dell'0rlando furioso di L. Ariosto e' quella fatta dal Mo rali con si giustamente lodata accuratezza. Egli non volle allontanarsi quasi punto dall' ortografia usata dall' Ariosto, e quindi mantenne il Ca vallieri e l' altretanto ecc.; voci che hanno presentemente difensori e imi tatori degni di molta stima. Abbiam voluto avvertire ci� perch� non cre desse alcuno che simil foggia di scrittura fosse difetto di correzione essendo in vece consiglio di elezione. E per conto della gerusalemme liberata di T. Tasso ci siamo valuti della stampa fattane nel is27 in Milano per cura del celebre letterato Giovanni Gherardini, come quella che vince nella bont� della lezione e del punteggiamento tutte le precedute. Questo � quanto al pregio letterario. Ora entrando alle altre cure diremo che si � posta ogni diligenza per amore che in cosi angusto spazio abbia un largo campo la leggiadria tipografica, e che, in occasione tanto facile a ingenerar abbagli per la minutezza del carattere, risultino continue prove di nostra attenzio ne. Ma per dirla col Parini: lungi per� da queste carte i cisposi occhi, gi� da un secolo rintuzzati; cotali diligenze non fanno per loro. Crediamo ancor a che debbano tornar gradito ornamento le XVI incisioni rappresentanti alcun fatto notabile del Poema a cui sono riferite, e che debban fare al trettanto i Ritratti di ciascun' Poeta, e che quindi il Pubblico voglia esserci cortese del suo favore, e grato dell'opera nostra.<br /><br />About the Publisher<br /><br />Forgotten Books publishes hundreds of thousands of rare and classic books.

His ""Divine Comedy"" is widely considered the greatest Italian literary work ever composed and a major contribution to world literature. This book of sonnets offers the reader a better glimpse at the writing of a man whose most famous work has been called a masterpiece of literary genius.<br /><br />For the reader who is not versed in poetry, sonnets are poems with fourteen lines that utilize a range of rhyme schemes and a range of topics. Even though the sonnet was made popular by the famous English writer William Shakespeare, this form of poetry actually originated in Italy making it a fitting form of writing for Dante to not only attempt but also engage successfully. This book allows for the reader to explore many of Dante's sonnets which offer a glimpse into Dante's writing style and his complicated personal beliefs. Each sonnet is a beautiful window into the personal experiences and thoughts of the author and affords the reader a one-of-a-kind glimpse into the life and times of the famous poet.<br /><br /><i>Dante, Petrarch, Camoens: CXXIV Sonnets</i> by Dante Alighieri is a wonderful compilation of sonnets written by one of the most famous authors known to students of literature. This book provides both an example of exemplary writing and a look into the personal experiences and life of the author. It is a great book for anyone interested in Dante, his life, his work, literature, or history.<br /><br />About the Publisher<br /><br />Forgotten Books publishes hundreds of thousands of rare and classic books.

Our aim is to provide readers with the highest quality reproductions of fiction and non-fiction literature that has stood the test of time. The many thousands of books in our collection have been sourced from libraries and private collections around the world.The titles that Trieste Publishing has chosen to be part of the collection have been scanned to simulate the original. Our readers see the books the same way that their first readers did decades or a hundred or more years ago. Books from that period are often spoiled by imperfections that did not exist in the original. Imperfections could be in the form of blurred text, photographs, or missing pages. It is highly unlikely that this would occur with one of our books. Our extensive quality control ensures that the readers of Trieste Publishing's books will be delighted with their purchase. Our staff has thoroughly reviewed every page of all the books in the collection, repairing, or if necessary, rejecting titles that are not of the highest quality. This process ensures that the reader of one of Trieste Publishing's titles receives a volume that faithfully reproduces the original, and to the maximum degree possible, gives them the experience of owning the original work.We pride ourselves on not only creating a pathway to an extensive reservoir of books of the finest quality, but also providing value to every one of our readers. Generally, Trieste books are purchased singly - on demand, however they may also be purchased in bulk. Readers interested in bulk purchases are invited to contact us directly to enquire about our tailored bulk rates."

His Divine Comedy, originally called Comed�a (modern Italian: Commedia) and later christened Divina by Giovanni Boccaccio, is widely considered the most important poem of the Middle Ages and the greatest literary work in the Italian language.The Divine Comedy is a long Italian narrative poem by Dante Alighieri, begun c. 1308 and completed in 1320, a year before his death in 1321. It is widely considered to be the pre-eminent work in Italian literature and one of the greatest works of world literature. The poem's imaginative vision of the afterlife is representative of the medieval world-view as it had developed in the Western Church by the 14th century. It helped establish the Tuscan language, in which it is written (also in most present-day Italian-market editions), as the standardized Italian language. It is divided into three parts: Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso."

Our aim is to provide readers with the highest quality reproductions of fiction and non-fiction literature that has stood the test of time. The many thousands of books in our collection have been sourced from libraries and private collections around the world.The titles that Trieste Publishing has chosen to be part of the collection have been scanned to simulate the original. Our readers see the books the same way that their first readers did decades or a hundred or more years ago. Books from that period are often spoiled by imperfections that did not exist in the original. Imperfections could be in the form of blurred text, photographs, or missing pages. It is highly unlikely that this would occur with one of our books. Our extensive quality control ensures that the readers of Trieste Publishing's books will be delighted with their purchase. Our staff has thoroughly reviewed every page of all the books in the collection, repairing, or if necessary, rejecting titles that are not of the highest quality. This process ensures that the reader of one of Trieste Publishing's titles receives a volume that faithfully reproduces the original, and to the maximum degree possible, gives them the experience of owning the original work.We pride ourselves on not only creating a pathway to an extensive reservoir of books of the finest quality, but also providing value to every one of our readers. Generally, Trieste books are purchased singly - on demand, however they may also be purchased in bulk. Readers interested in bulk purchases are invited to contact us directly to enquire about our tailored bulk rates."

These beautiful books make perfect gifts or a treat for any book lover. This edition is the English translation by Dante Gabriel Rossetti which was first published in The Early Italian Poets in 1861 and then reissued in 1874 by Dante and his Circle. It was met with great acclaim acknowledging Rossetti’s skill as a meticulous and poetic translator.<br /><br />From the first time the poet sets eyes on Beatrice, he says ‘love quite governed my soul’ and his devotion to her knows no end. By recalling each meeting with Beatrice, including a rejection by her, this short book is at once a heartfelt account of youthful love and a religious allegory. <i>La Vita Nuova</i> serves as an important precursor to Dante’s masterpiece, <i>The Divine Comedy</i>."

Our aim is to provide readers with the highest quality reproductions of fiction and non-fiction literature that has stood the test of time. The many thousands of books in our collection have been sourced from libraries and private collections around the world.The titles that Trieste Publishing has chosen to be part of the collection have been scanned to simulate the original. Our readers see the books the same way that their first readers did decades or a hundred or more years ago. Books from that period are often spoiled by imperfections that did not exist in the original. Imperfections could be in the form of blurred text, photographs, or missing pages. It is highly unlikely that this would occur with one of our books. Our extensive quality control ensures that the readers of Trieste Publishing's books will be delighted with their purchase. Our staff has thoroughly reviewed every page of all the books in the collection, repairing, or if necessary, rejecting titles that are not of the highest quality. This process ensures that the reader of one of Trieste Publishing's titles receives a volume that faithfully reproduces the original, and to the maximum degree possible, gives them the experience of owning the original work.We pride ourselves on not only creating a pathway to an extensive reservoir of books of the finest quality, but also providing value to every one of our readers. Generally, Trieste books are purchased singly - on demand, however they may also be purchased in bulk. Readers interested in bulk purchases are invited to contact us directly to enquire about our tailored bulk rates."

It is widely considered to be the pre-eminent work in Italian literature and one of the greatest works of world literature.<br /><br /><br /> Dante's Divine Comedy, a landmark in Italian literature and among the greatest works of all medieval European literature, is a profound Christian vision of humankind's temporal and eternal destiny. On its most personal level, it draws on Dante's own experience of exile from his native city of Florence. On its most comprehensive level, it may be read as an allegory, taking the form of a journey through hell, purgatory, and paradise. The poem amazes by its array of learning, its penetrating and comprehensive analysis of contemporary problems, and its inventiveness of language and imagery. By choosing to write his poem in the Italian vernacular rather than in Latin, Dante decisively influenced the course of literary development. (He primarily used the Tuscan dialect, which would become standard literary Italian, but his vivid vocabulary ranged widely over many dialects and languages.) Not only did he lend a voice to the emerging lay culture of his own country, but Italian became the literary language in western Europe for several centuries.<br /><br />In addition to poetry Dante wrote important theoretical works ranging from discussions of rhetoric to moral philosophy and political thought. He was fully conversant with the classical tradition, drawing for his own purposes on such writers as Virgil, Cicero, and Boethius. But, most unusual for a layman, he also had an impressive command of the most recent scholastic philosophy and of theology. His learning and his personal involvement in the heated political controversies of his age led him to the composition of De monarchia, one of the major tracts of medieval political philosophy."

It is an allegory telling of Dante's journey through Heaven, guided by Beatrice, who symbolises theology.<br /><br /><br /> Dante's Divine Comedy, a landmark in Italian literature and among the greatest works of all medieval European literature, is a profound Christian vision of humankind's temporal and eternal destiny. On its most personal level, it draws on Dante's own experience of exile from his native city of Florence. On its most comprehensive level, it may be read as an allegory, taking the form of a journey through hell, purgatory, and paradise. The poem amazes by its array of learning, its penetrating and comprehensive analysis of contemporary problems, and its inventiveness of language and imagery. By choosing to write his poem in the Italian vernacular rather than in Latin, Dante decisively influenced the course of literary development. (He primarily used the Tuscan dialect, which would become standard literary Italian, but his vivid vocabulary ranged widely over many dialects and languages.) Not only did he lend a voice to the emerging lay culture of his own country, but Italian became the literary language in western Europe for several centuries.<br /><br />In addition to poetry Dante wrote important theoretical works ranging from discussions of rhetoric to moral philosophy and political thought. He was fully conversant with the classical tradition, drawing for his own purposes on such writers as Virgil, Cicero, and Boethius. But, most unusual for a layman, he also had an impressive command of the most recent scholastic philosophy and of theology. His learning and his personal involvement in the heated political controversies of his age led him to the composition of De monarchia, one of the major tracts of medieval political philosophy."

The poem was written in the early 14th century.<br /><br /><br /> Dante's Divine Comedy, a landmark in Italian literature and among the greatest works of all medieval European literature, is a profound Christian vision of humankind's temporal and eternal destiny. On its most personal level, it draws on Dante's own experience of exile from his native city of Florence. On its most comprehensive level, it may be read as an allegory, taking the form of a journey through hell, purgatory, and paradise. The poem amazes by its array of learning, its penetrating and comprehensive analysis of contemporary problems, and its inventiveness of language and imagery. By choosing to write his poem in the Italian vernacular rather than in Latin, Dante decisively influenced the course of literary development. (He primarily used the Tuscan dialect, which would become standard literary Italian, but his vivid vocabulary ranged widely over many dialects and languages.) Not only did he lend a voice to the emerging lay culture of his own country, but Italian became the literary language in western Europe for several centuries.<br /><br />In addition to poetry Dante wrote important theoretical works ranging from discussions of rhetoric to moral philosophy and political thought. He was fully conversant with the classical tradition, drawing for his own purposes on such writers as Virgil, Cicero, and Boethius. But, most unusual for a layman, he also had an impressive command of the most recent scholastic philosophy and of theology. His learning and his personal involvement in the heated political controversies of his age led him to the composition of De monarchia, one of the major tracts of medieval political philosophy."

Divina comedia es parte de esta gran colección. <br /> <br />Perdido y obstruido en una selva oscura, Dante divisa a su escritor predilecto, Virgilio, quien, manifestando su propósito celestial, lo guía a través de los confines subterráneos del Infierno. Tras observar las terribles condenas de quienes obraron en contra de las leyes de Dios, los dos poetas llegan al monte Purgatorio, en el que Dante deberá purificarse y despedirse de su acompañante. <br />Ya reunido con su protectora y nueva guía, Beatriz, Dante volará por los más altos cielos, donde será iluminado y conocerá la verdad absoluta de la creación. <br /> <br />La Divina comedia (1321) es obra cumbre que condensa y critica gran parte del pensamiento clásico y teológico de la época. <br />"

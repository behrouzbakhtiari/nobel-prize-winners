In seventy-six chapters he traces philosophy from the rise of Greek civilization to the emergence of logical analysis in the twentieth century. Among the philosophers considered are: Pythagoras, Heraclitus, Parmenides, Empedocles, Anaxagoras, the Atomists, Protagoras, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, the Cynics, the Sceptics, the Epicureans, the Stoics, Plotinus, Ambrose, Jerome, Augustine, Benedict, Gregory the Great, John the Scot, Aquinas, Duns Scotus, William of Occam, Machiavelli, Erasmus, More, Bacon, Hobbes, Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, Rousseau, Kant, Hegel, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, the Utilitarians, Marx, Bergson, James, Dewey, and lastly the philosophers with whom Lord Russell himself is most closely associated -- Cantor, Frege, and Whitehead, co-author with Russell of the monumental <i>Principia Mathematica.</i>"

He brings to his treatment of these questions the same courage, scrupulous logic, and lofty wisdom for which his other work as philosopher, writer, and teacher has been famous. These qualities make the essays included in this book perhaps the most graceful and moving presentation of the freethinker's position since the days of Hume and Voltaire. <p> ""I am as firmly convinced that religions do harm as I am that they are untrue,"" Russell declares in his Preface, and his reasoned opposition to any system or dogma which he feels may shackle man's mind runs through all the essays in this book, whether they were written as early as 1899 or as late as 1954. </p><p> The book has been edited, with Lord Russell's full approval and cooperation, by Professor Paul Edwards of the Philosophy Department of New York University. In an Appendix, Professor Edwards contributes a full account of the highly controversial ""Bertrand Russell Case"" of 1940, in which Russell was judicially declared ""unfit"" to teach philosophy at the College of the City of New York. </p><p> Whether the reader shares or rejects Bertrand Russell's views, he will find this book an invigorating challenge to set notions, a masterly statement of a philosophical position, and a pure joy to read.</p>"

He famously summarized the book in the following words: 'What can be said at all can be said clearly; and what we cannot talk about we must pass over in silence.' David Pears and Brian McGuinness received the highest praise for their meticulous translation. The work is prefaced by Bertrand Russell's original introduction to the first English edition."

That assertion underlies this book, a seminal work in the field for more than 70 years. In it, Russell offers a nontechnical, undogmatic account of his philosophical criticism as it relates to arithmetic and logic. Rather than an exhaustive treatment, however, the influential philosopher and mathematician focuses on certain issues of mathematical logic that, to his mind, invalidated much traditional and contemporary philosophy.<br />In dealing with such topics as number, order, relations, limits and continuity, propositional functions, descriptions, and classes, Russell writes in a clear, accessible manner, requiring neither a knowledge of mathematics nor an aptitude for mathematical symbolism. The result is a thought-provoking excursion into the fascinating realm where mathematics and philosophy meet — a philosophical classic that will be welcomed by any thinking person interested in this crucial area of modern thought."

Both are best fostered in the family, in education, and in religion - each of which Russell proceeds to discuss.<br /> The ideas expressed in <em>Principles of Social Reconstruction</em> have greatly contributed to Russell's fame as a social critic and anti-war activist.

In those years the author was teaching philosophy at American universities and exercising a growing influence on America's student population. The essays assembled here are fundamentally concerned with ""the art of reckoning"" in the fields of mathematics, logic and philosophy. The simplicity of Russell's exposition is astonishing, as is his ability to get to the core of the great philosophical issues and to skillfully probe the depth of philosophical analysis. Bertrand Arthur William Russell, 3rd Earl Russell was a British philosopher, logician, mathematician, historian, social reformer, and pacifist. Although he spent the majority of his life in England, he was born in Wales, where he also died. Russell led the British ""revolt against Idealism"" in the early 1900s and is considered one of the founders of analytic philosophy along with his prot�g� Wittgenstein and his elder Frege. He co-authored, with A. N. Whitehead, Principia Mathematica, an attempt to ground mathematics on logic. His philosophical essay ""On Denoting"" has been considered a ""paradigm of philosophy."" Both works have had a considerable influence on logic, mathematics, set theory, linguistics and analytic philosophy. He was a prominent anti-war activist, championing free trade between nations and anti-imperialism. Russell was imprisoned for his pacifist activism during World War I, campaigned against Adolf Hitler, for nuclear disarmament, criticized Soviet totalitarianism and the United States of America's involvement in the Vietnam War. In 1950, Russell was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, ""in recognition of his varied and significant writings in which he champions humanitarian ideals and freedom of thought."""

I cannot promise the reader that at any point he will shake his sides with laughter, but I can promise him a wry pleasure to be derived from the skilful dissection of folly.” </i> <b>Bertrand Russell </b><br /><br /><br />Professor Mmaa’s Lecture, given to a packed auditorium, deals with the habits, mentality and culture of Homo sapiens. But both the professor and his entire audience are termites; the whole story is set inside a termite mound.<br /><br />Naturally, Themerson’s attempt to comprehend humankind by examining how they would have been understood by insects is very funny. Termites have no sight, just a sense of smell, and can only explain their surroundings and lives through their insects’ angle on the world. The closing scene of the novel reveals what the termites have been researching and what has happened to their mound, giving the whole story an ironic twist.<br /><br />But this novel has much more to offer. Themerson’s heightened expertise and instinct for parodying the language and methods of scholarship, and the morals and manners of the academic world, produces a merciless and comical survey of philosophical views and attitudes. He pillories religion, language, reason and scholarship, as insect thinkers with suspiciously familiar names scuttle through the pages of the novel. A great many cases of dogmatic thinking and narrow-mindedness are exposed to ridicule. The only path that seems to earn the author’s approval is pluralism of ideas. You can see just why Bertrand Russell calls this novel a useful gospel for sceptics.<br /><br />Professor Mmaa’s Lecture is in the tradition of philosophical satire, whose most famous proponents are Voltaire and Swift, and is a rare incidence of light yet deep prose that can be read with great pleasure on several levels."

In this volume, thanks to the Estate of Albert Einstein, the complete story is told of how one of the greatest minds of modern times worked from 1914 to 1955 on the problem of peace. It is a fascinating record of a man's courage, his sincerity, and his concern for those who survive him. <br /><br />This book is also a history of the peace movement in modern times. Here are letters to and from some of the most famous men of his generation, including between Einstein and Freud on aggression and war, and to President Roosevelt reporting the theoretical possibility of nuclear fission. It is the living record of more than 40 years of Einstein's intriguing struggle to mobilize forces all over the world for the abolition of war and the creation of a supranational organization to solve conflicts among nations."

It was the text of a lecture read to the Heretics Society, an intellectual club at Cambridge University on 4 February 1923.<br /><br />Haldane uses the Greek myth of Daedalus as a symbol for the revolutionary nature of science with particular regard to his own discipline of biology.<br /><br />""The chemical or physical inventor is always a Prometheus. There is no great invention, from fire to flying, which has not been hailed as an insult to some god. But if every physical and chemical invention is a blasphemy, every biological invention is a perversion. There is hardly one which, on first being brought to the notice of an observer from any nation which had not previously heard of their existence, would not appear to him as indecent and unnatural.""<br /><br />He also expressed skepticism over the human benefits of some scientific advances, arguing that scientific advance would bring grief, rather than progress to mankind, unless it was accompanied by a similar advance in ethics.<br /><br />The book is an early vision of transhumanism and his vision of a future in which humans controlled their own evolution through directed mutation and use of in vitro fertilization (""ectogenesis"") was a major influence on Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. The book ends with the image of a biologist, much like Haldane himself, in a laboratory: ""just a poor little scrubby underpaid man groping blindly<br /><br />The book has been discussed at length by other writers, including Freeman Dyson in his book ""Imagined Worlds"", ""Science, Society, and Values"" by Sal.

Written with Dora Black (who became Russell's second wife) on a trip to China in 1920, it is revealing both as a period piece and as a book for our times. Russell criticises his own age, and demonstrates how humanity perpetually struggles against the centralising forces of industrialism and nationalism.<br /> He views industrialism as a threat to human freedom, as it creates large populations which have to be subject to controls and he likens Bolshevik Russia to Cromwell's England, asserting that both were dictatorships designed to force an essentially feudal society to adopt industrialism. He sees industrialism and nationalism as fundamentally linked and proposes one government for the whole world as a solution.<br /> Russell is not blind to the positive side of industrialism; without machines an economy of subsistence would be the best for which society could hope, but argues that the global village and prevailing political democracy should be its eventual results."

He is clear, engaging, and readable. Although Russell did most of his early work (along with his mentor and colleague Alfred North Whitehead) in mathematics, he had an enormously wide range of interests-from politics to sex education for the young. The following two essays-Mysticism and Logic and Mathematics and the Metaphysicians-provide the reader with a glimpse into Russell's thinking and, in turn, illuminates us about these deep subjects. Even though Russell is a seasoned skeptic, he is not blind to how religious sentiments and emotions play a vital role in our day-to-day lives. This is perhaps best summarized by Russell when he writes ""The metaphysical creed, I shall maintain, is a mistaken outcome of the emotion, although this emotion, as colouring and informing all other thoughts and feelings, is the inspirer of whatever is best in Man. Even the cautious and patient investigation of truth by science, which seems the very antithesis of the mystic's swift certainty, may be fostered and nourished by that very spirit of reverence in which mysticism lives and moves."" Bertrand Russell remains a beacon of enlightenment for those wanting to better understand the universe through reason and logic and love."

While teaching at Cambridge University Russell created his most notable works, Principles of Mathematics (1903) and, with Alfred North Whitehead, Principia Mathematica (3 vol., 1910–13), in which he endeavored to demonstrate how the laws of mathematics could be deduced from the basic axioms of logic. His work influenced 20th-century symbolic logic, set theory in mathematics, and logical positivism, especially in the work of his student Ludwig Wittgenstein. An undogmatic but fervent rationalist, Russell was extremely convinced of the logical independence of individual facts and the dependence of knowledge on the data of original experience. Well known for his social views, he was an energetic pacifist during World War I. In 1927 he and his wife founded the extremely experimental Beacon Hill School. His liberal views on marriage, sex, adultery, and homosexuality made him controversial during most of the 1930s. He deserted pacifism during World War II in the face of the Nazi menace, but returned to it after the war, becoming a leader in the “ban the bomb” movement to stop the manufacture of nuclear weapons. In the 1960s he and Jean-Paul Sartre organized European opposition to U.S. participation in the Vietnam War. Russell's radicalism kept him from a conventional academic career, and he sustained himself primarily by his writings, many of them extensively read, e.g., Marriage and Morals (1929), A History of Western Philosophy (1945), and his autobiography (3 vol., 1967–69). In 1950 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature.<br />"

As such it is an invaluable resource, not only for students of philosophy, but also for those interested in understanding Russell's philosophical development.

In their separate efforts to clarify mathematics through the use of logic in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, Frege and Russell both recognized the need for rigorous and systematic semantic analysis of language. It was their turn to this style of analysis that would establish the philosophy of language as an autonomous area of inquiry. This anthology gathers together these foundational writings, and frames them with an extensive historical introduction. This is a collection for anyone interested in questions about truth, meaning, reference, and logic, and in the application of formal analysis to these concepts."

Cet exposé sert de préambule à une analyse minutieuse des nombreux problèmes auxquels l'humanité devra faire face si elle veut reconstruire le monde dévasté par la guerre.

Since Russell was not involved in seeing the earlier of these books through the press, its text has no authority. Russell had a long association with the Rationalist Press Association, as did his older brother, Frank, the second Earl Russell. Both lent their names, from 1928 until their deaths, as Honorary Associates, to the Association's masthead, and both contributed a number of articles to the RPA's various publications."

His next book in academic philosophy, An Inquiry into Meaning and Truth, was not published until 1940.<br />Yet, Russell published a significant amount of essays and popular books between 1927 and 1946, mostly to finance the running of Beacon Hill School, and his growing family. Those years also saw his break-up with Dora Russell, his marriage to Patricia (Peter) Spence and a move of the family to the United States. <br />Volume 10 brings together Russell's writings on ethics, politics, religion and academic philsophy. It is an invaluable guide to the thought and development of one of the most famous philosophers of this century."

A mentegetőzés az egyes iskolák, ill. filozófusok szakértőit illeti. Talán Leibniz kivételével, az általam tárgyalt filozófusok mindegyikét mások jobban ismerik nálamnál. De ha egyáltalán szükség van átfogó tanulmányok írására, akkor - mivel nem vagyunk halhatatlanok - az ilyen jellegű könyvek írói óhatatlanul kevesebbet időzhetnek egy-egy részkérdésnél, mint azok a kutatók, akik csak egyetlen gondolkodóra vagy rövidebb korszakra összpontosítanak. A megalkuvást nem ismerő tudományos szigor ebből nyilván arra következtet, hogy egyáltalán nem szabad átfogó tanulmányt írni, vagy ha igen, akkor annak több szerző által írt monográfiákból kell állnia. Ez utóbbi esetben azonban valami mindig elsikkad. Ha létezik egység a történelem menetében, ha van belső kapcsolat az előzmények és a későbbi történések között, akkor ezek kifejtéséhez az egyes korszakoknak szükségképpen egy ember gondolkodásában kell összpontosulniuk. A Rousseau-kutató esetleg nehezen boldogul kutatása tárgya és a Platón- vagy Plutarkhosz-korabeli Spárta összefüggéseivel, a Spárta történetével foglalkozóban aligha tudatosul a hobbesi, fichtei vagy lenini filozófiával való kapcsolat.

При тези опити темата за езика, неговия анализ и критика - и изобщо за условията за смисленото говорене - става централна. Това води не само до неподозиран разцвет на логическото изследване, но и до обрат във философската визия за света.<br /><br />Настоящият сборник от избрани класически текстове на Фреге, Ръсел, Мур и Витгенщайн предлага за пръв път на българския читател един цялостен и систематичен обзор на техните основни идеи в областта на философията на логиката."

Un bambino è come un albero"", è un'antologia originale di scritti di Bertrand Russell: saggi, aforismi e alcuni articoli inediti in Italia sul tema dell'educazione dei figli e dell'istruzione. Tra le molteplici attività di Bertrand Russell - logico, matematico, divulgatore scientifico, filosofo e pacifista - vi fu anche quella, meno nota ma comunque centrale all'interno della sua biografia, di filosofo dell'educazione ed educatore. Dopo il disastro della prima guerra mondiale Russell vedeva infatti nell'educazione la sola forza in grado di rimodellare e riformare dalle fondamenta la società occidentale. Ma per innescare una tale riforma, per poter crescere ""uomini diversi"", era necessario ripensare radicalmente i ruoli, le funzioni e i comportamenti delle agenzie educative su cui si regge l'educazione degli uomini moderni: Stato, genitori e insegnanti. Nella visione di Russell tali agenzie vanno non ribaltate, ma ripensate profondamente: da veri e propri ostacoli per lo sviluppo individuale - per cui l'educazione è una mera ""arma politica"" in vista di fini esterni all'individuo - a fattori finalmente positivi, creativi, tesi all'arricchimento e al completamento della personalità, alla creazione di caratteri aperti alla cooperazione, alla gentilezza, alla pace."

The second half of this book will be reprinted under the title, Freedom versus Organization, 1776-1914. The half of this book which is here reprinted deals first with conventional diplomacy from the Congress of Vienna to the out break of revolutions in 1848, a period during which European Governments remained aristocratic, reactionary, and traditional, representing in the main the interests of landowners. It then passes to the new antiaristocratic outlook inspired by indus trialism, from Malthtis to Marx. This outlook expressed, at first, the interests of employers, but afterwards that of wage earners. Of this new outlook, official diplomacy remained ignorant. The second half of the original book, now a separate volume, leals first with the growth and new importance of the United States and then with the official relations of European States to the outbreak of war in 1914, showing a close resemblance to the Congress of Vienna in spite of aft, the vast changes in the world during the intervening century. Throughout both books one constant theme is the fluctuating fortunes of liberalism. Liberalism, as inherited from the eighteenth century, was an individualistic doctrine. It believed in the Rights of Man and a mimmurn of governmental interference. Its ideal was a population of peasant proprietors and handicrafts men. But industrial technique developed vast monopolies, possessing great power, and allowing individual initiative only to a few immensely influential captains of industry. Laisser faire proved selfdestructive, and failed to bring the hopedfor freedom. It appeared that, if freedom was to be recovered, a new social philosophy was needed. The outcome of this development is dealt with in the second book, which should be read jointly with the first. CONTENTS INTRODUCTION PART ONE: THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGITIMACY i. Napoleons Successors ii.

Lo que han tenido es paternalismo, dictadura, totalitarismo. Pero no democracia. Lo que les falta por probar justamente, es si la democracia verdadera resuelve sus problemas.<br /> Hay mucha confusión acerca de conceptos como libertad y democracia y de sus fundamentos. Por esto, hemos reunido una serie de ensayos acerca de estos temas. Los de Bertrand Russell, el famoso filósofo británico, Premio Nobel y excéntrico pacifista, definen la libertad. el de Stafford Cripps, laborista inglés que fue ministro en 1945 y años siguientes, y que puede considerarse como uno de los artífices de la independencia de las colonias británicas de Asia y de la revolución inglesa de 1945-51 define los límites que la economía moderna pone a la democracia. Reinhold Niebuhr, teólogo protestate norteamericano, plantea la cuestión del optimismo y el pesimismo en relación con la democracia.<br /><br />De estos ensayos se han suprimido —por razón de espacio— las alusiones a hechos o situaciones que ya han sido superados.

According to Wikipedia: Bertrand Arthur William Russell, 3rd Earl Russell, OM, FRS (18 May 1872 – 2 February 1970), was a British philosopher, logician, mathematician, historian, pacifist, and social critic. He spent most of his life in England; he was born in Wales where he also died, aged 97. Russell led the British ""revolt against idealism"" in the early 1900s. He is considered one of the founders of analytic philosophy along with his predecessor Gottlob Frege and his protégé Ludwig Wittgenstein, and is widely held to be one of the 20th century's premier logicians.

His work has had a considerable influence on logic, mathematics, set theory, linguistics, and philosophy, especially philosophy of language, epistemology, and metaphysics. Russell was a prominent anti-war activist; he championed free trade and anti-imperialism. Russell went to prison for his pacifist activism during World War I. Later, he campaigned against Adolf Hitler, then criticised Stalinist totalitarianism, attacked the United States of America's involvement in the Vietnam War, and finally became an outspoken proponent of nuclear disarmament.

Although he spent the majority of his life in England, he was born in Wales, where he also died. Russell led the British ""revolt against idealism"" in the early 1900s and is considered one of the founders of analytic philosophy along with his protege Wittgenstein and his elder Frege. He co-authored, with A. N. Whitehead, Principia Mathematica, an attempt to ground mathematics on logic. His philosophical essay ""On Denoting"" has been considered a ""paradigm of philosophy."" Both works have had a considerable influence on logic, mathematics, set theory, linguistics and analytic philosophy. He was a prominent anti-war activist, championing free trade between nations and anti-imperialism.

Eight previously unpublished papers shed light on his different versions of a substitutional theory of logic, with its elimination of classes and relations, during 1905-06. A recurring issue for him was whether a type hierarchy had to be part of a substitutional theory. In mid-1907 he began writing up the final version of Principia, now using a ramified theory of types, and eleven unpublished drafts from 1907-08 deal with this. Numerous letters show his thoughts on the process.<br /><br />The volume's 80-page introduction covers the evolution of his logic from 1896 until 1909, when volume I of Principia went to the printer."

Focusing on problems he believes will provoke positive and constructive discussion, Russell concentrates on knowledge rather than metaphysics: If it is uncertain that external objects exist, how can we then have knowledge of them but by probability. There is no reason to doubt the existence of external objects simply because of sense data.Russell guides the reader through his famous 1910 distinction between knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by description and introduces important theories of Plato, Aristotle, Ren� Descartes, David Hume, John Locke, Immanuel Kant, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and others to lay the foundation for philosophical inquiry by general readers and scholars alike.In the following pages I have confined myself in the main to those problems of philosophy in regard to which I thought it possible to say something positive and constructive, since merely negative criticism seemed out of place. For this reason, theory of knowledge occupies a larger space than metaphysics in the present volume, and some topics much discussed by philosophers are treated very briefly, if at all."

Eight previously unpublished papers shed light on his different versions of a substitutional theory of logic, with its elimination of classes and relations, during 1905-06. A recurring issue for him was whether a type hierarchy had to be part of a substitutional theory. In mid-1907 he began writing up the final version of <em>Principia</em>, now using a ramified theory of types, and eleven unpublished drafts from 1907-08 deal with this. Numerous letters show his thoughts on the process.<br /><br />The volume's 80-page introduction covers the evolution of his logic from 1896 until 1909, when volume I of <em>Principia </em>went to the printer."

The activism of which we glimpse the initial stirrings in this volume continued in various guises more or less without interruption until his death. In the writings assembled in this volume, however, he is looking towards the non-aligned states and world scientific opinion as possible brokers of <em>d�tente</em>. (The volume includes Russell's famous public statement, the declaration of scientists known as 'The Russell Einstein Manifesto'.) Although Russell was becoming increasingly immersed in work for peace, this was not to the exclusion of all other interests. For example, here we find also him reminiscing about his peace campaigning during the First World War, defending 'History as an Art', and attacking the obscurantism of obscenity legislation and the opponents of birth control."

I met a lady once who<br />maintained that no child should ever<br />be forbidden to do anything, because<br />a child ought to develop its nature<br />from within. ""How if its nature leads<br />it to swallow pins?"" I asked; but I regret<br />to say the answer was mere vituperation.<br />And yet every child, left to<br />itself, will sooner or later swallow pins,<br />drink poison out of medicine-bottles,<br />fall out of an upper window, or otherwise<br />bring itself to a bad end. At a<br />slightly later age boys, when they have<br />the opportunity, will go unwashed,<br />overeat, smoke till they are sick, catch<br />chills from sitting in wet feet, and so<br />on, let alone the fact that they will<br />amuse themselves by plaguing elderly<br />gentlemen, who may not all have Elisha's<br />powers of repartee. Therefore,<br />one who advocates freedom in education<br />cannot mean that children should<br />do exactly as they please all day long.<br />An element of discipline and authority<br />must exist; the question is as to the<br />amount of it, and the way in which it is<br />to be exercised.<br />Education may be viev/ed from<br />many points of view: that of the state,<br />of the church, of the schoolmaster, of<br />the parent, or even (though this is<br />usually forgotten) of the child itself.<br />Each of these points of view is partial,<br />each contributes something to the idea!<br />of education, but also contributes elements<br />that are bad. Let us examine<br />them successively, and see what is to<br />be said for and against them.<br />We will begin with the state as the<br />most powerful force in deciding what<br />modern education is to be. The interest<br />of the state in education is very<br />recent. It did not exist in antiquity<br />or the Middle Ages; until the Renaissance<br />education was valued only by<br />the church. The Renaissance brought<br />an interest in advanced scholarship,<br />leading to the foundation of such institutions<br />as the College de France, intended<br />to offset the ecclesiastical Sorbonne.<br />The Reformation in England<br />and Germany brought a desire on the<br />part of the state to have some control<br />over universities and grammar-schools,<br />to prevent them from remaining ""hotbeds<br />of popery."" But this interest<br />soon evaporated. The state took no<br />decisive or continuous part until the<br />quite modern movement for universal<br />compulsory education. Nevertheless,<br />the state now has more to say to scholastic<br />institutions than have all the<br />other factors combined."

After that date, only the occasional philosophical piece appeared, as he was preoccupied with political writings. In this volume there are a handful of papers dated later than 1959, and all of these were certainly written by Russell himself.<br />This volume contains Russell's writings on diverse philosophical interests, including autobiographical and self-critical papers, critiques of other philosophers and his controversial opinions on Christianity."

Writings from early in 1889, where he advances beyond his initial insights and develops a range of new ideas in the philosophy of logic, form the remainder of the volume."

Elle est le témoin de la formation de sa philosophie, dont on sait qu'elle a subi de nombreux changements avant de trouver sa formulation définitive. Que ce soit d'un point de vue technique ou philosophique, ces documents manifestent le travail quia conduit à de grands ouvrages (dont The Principles of Mathematics) ou à de fameux articles (dont "" On Denoting ""), enfin à la philosophie de l'atomisme logique.

Whoever contemplates the world in the light of an ideal-whether what he seeks be intellect, or art, or love, or simple happiness, or all together-must feel a great sorrow in the evils that men needlessly allow to continue, and-if he be a man of force and vital energy-an urgent desire to lead men to the realization of the good which inspires his creative vision. It is this desire which has been the primary force moving the pioneers of Socialism and Anarchism, as it moved the inventors of ideal commonwealths in the past. In this there is nothing new. What is new in Socialism and Anarchism, is that close relation of the ideal to the present sufferings of men, which has enabled powerful political movements to grow out of the hopes of solitary thinkers. It is this that makes Socialism and Anarchism important, and it is this that makes them dangerous to those who batten, consciously or unconsciously upon the evils of our present order of society.<br /><br />- Taken from ""Proposed Roads To Freedom"" written by Bertrand Russell"

The aim of politics should be to make the lives of individuals as good as possible.The best life is the one in which the creative impulses play the largest part and the possessive impulses the smallest.A bad teacher will aim at imposing his opinion, and turning out a set of pupils all of whom will give the same definite answer on a doubtful point. Mr. Bernard Shaw is said to hold that Troilus and Cressida is the best of Shakespeare's plays. Although I disagree with this opinion, I should welcome it in a pupil as a sign of individuality; but most teachers would not tolerate such a heterodox view. Not only teachers, but all commonplace persons in authority, desire in their subordinates that kind of uniformity which makes their actions easily predictable and never inconvenient. The result is that they crush initiative and individuality when they can, and when they cannot, they quarrel with it.A large part of the best brains of the country are in the civil service, where the condition of their employment is silence about the evils which cannot be concealed from them. A Nonconformist minister loses his livelihood if his views displease his congregation; a member of Parliament loses his seat if he is not sufficiently supple or sufficiently stupid to follow or share all the turns and twists of public opinion. In every walk of life, independence of mind is punished by failure, more and more as economic organizations grow larger and more rigid."

Whitehead), fra le tante opere che rivendicano la libertà dell’individuo positivista e laico si ricordano: Socialismo, anarchismo e sindacalismo (Socialism, anarchism and sindacalism, 1918), Le prospettive della civiltà industriale (The prospects of industrial civilization, 1923), A cosa credo (What I believe, 1925), Perché non sono cristiano (Why I am not a christian, 1927), La conquista della felicità (The conquest of happiness, 1930), Elogio dell’ozio (In praise of idleness, 1935), Che cos’è la «democrazia» (What is democracy, 1953), e l’ Autobiografia (Autobiography, 1968), fra le sue opere più belle.<br /><br />Biografia tratta parzialmente dall'Enciclopedia Garzanti della letteratura."

Volume One Only. Full facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition software. Originally published in three volumes. There is no doubt that <em>Principia Mathematica</em> [PM] is of great importance in the history of mathematics and philosophy: it sparked interest in symbolic logic and advanced the subject by popularizing it; it showcased the powers and capacities of symbolic logic; and it showed how advances in philosophy of mathematics and symbolic logic could go hand-in-hand with tremendous fruitfulness. Indeed, PM was in part brought about by an interest in Logicism, the view on which all mathematical truths are logical truths. It was in part thanks to the advances made in PM that, despite its defects, numerous advances in meta-logic were made, including G�del's incompleteness theorems. The scholarly, historical, and philosophical interest in PM is great and ongoing: for example, the <em>Modern Library</em> ranked it 23rd in a list of the top 100 English-language nonfiction books of the twentieth century."
